This pandemic has bedeviled me with many hurdles to overcome and has drastically changed my life. The most difficult barrier I've had to overcome was getting simulated with the new covid-19 environment. As an international transfer student from Guyana, it was extremely difficult adjusting to my new environment even before covid 19 existed, after the pandemic struck things became ten-times worse. I only had the privilege to experience what it felt like attending classes on campus for two months, after which learning shifted to a remote setting. Never in my life prior to covid have I taken an online class, even throughout my years at the University of Guyana, therefore it was a strain to learn. Online classes for some courses required us to read all the material and learn on our own and I learn better during a class discussion, therefore, asynchronous learning was challenging. There were short comings during the trial-and-error period as Medgar Evers College transitioned into remote teaching, learning seemed impossible; some professors were unable to sufficiently use the online resources that were available to adequately teach their material; since there was a lack of student-professor interaction it became very difficult to ask questions or even get a response after a question has been asked in a timely fashion or even at all.  Getting simulated with the new covid-19 environment meant also not being able to physically see family or friends since the virus was so deadly and was easily transferrable from person to person. As a very family-oriented person this was punishing since the small amount of my family residing close by couldn't have been visited. The government restriction on international travel made my experiences worsen, even though I was yearning to return home to visit close relatives it couldn't happen. However, technology made my experience of dealing with the lock down a little better. I became more computer literate, got better at speed and accurately typing documents. I personally created family 'WhatsApp' groups where we were able to keep in touch with one another. We also utilized Zoom online meetings to celebrate certain occasions such as birthdays and our annual family Christman gift exchange. We even utilized virtual platforms to exercise since gyms were closed.  This pandemic has thought me that life is short and that every moment of it should never be taken for granted, we should give love at every opportunity and maintain peace between our brothers and sisters. We will always be faced with adversary, but the decision is ours to either use it to grow or be consumed by it.

In March of 2020, that was the last time I would ever step foot in my high school and right then my world changed. Because of the coronavirus people began to lose jobs and get their hours cut at work, my stepfather was one of these people and his income helped a lot around the house. So, here I am about seventeen years old, working remote for school and trying to find a job to help financially. I ended up quitting sports and extra activities I found interesting to just work and focus on finishing high school. This was extremely hard for me because in March of 2020 I never thought I would have to put some things aside to handle finances. I lost a big part of my childhood and this forced me to grow up because I knew I had responsibilities. I eventually figured out what college I would attend, and today I'm now enrolled at North Carolina A&T State University as a first-year undergraduate student. COVID set my family back a lot financially to the point where I had to take out loans just to attend school. Being a first-generation college student, I didn't let any of this stop me and I will forever be determined to succeed, and although this was a challenge it was something I learned from and has taught me to always work hard and push through difficult times.

In the Fall of 2020, I started college with the hopes of being in person, but to my dismay we were still online for the entirety of the semester, and this is where the challenge really occurred for me.   Starting my first year of college online made it very difficult to get accustomed to the ""normal"" college setting of working and socializing with peers, going to lectures in person, and staying on campus to study or hang out with friends. Instead, I was faced with attending classes on Zoom and not being able to go on campus at all. With Zoom, it was a rocky start with getting used to sitting on a computer all day listening to a professor speak with no real class interaction as most students, including myself, weren't as engaged and didn't have their cameras on. It was also much more difficult to really enjoy my classes and not just do the work to get a passing grade, though the exceptions were with my accounting and ethics class where they were much more engaged, and topics I really enjoyed learning about.   There was also the difficulty with socializing. Not being able to be on campus made it very difficult to talk to my peers and make friends. I did join clubs, GroupMe chats, follow the social media of my peers, and join breakout groups in classes to try and get some sort of interaction, but it still wasn't the same and few connections were made. This made it difficult to really enjoy school, as I felt as if I was in my own world and cut off from society. I even considered possibly transferring because I felt so disconnected from my school. It wasn't until I started meeting with my mentor for a student diversity club I joined where she really helped me feel more connected and became a friend I could talk to about my challenges.   The final challenge with being online for school was being at home because I couldn't really get into a school focus zone. It was very difficult for me to establish a time to work and study, and a time to relax, especially with all my siblings being home. There was no separate quiet space I could use for my own. In time, I just had to adapt and use what space I could, as well as set a time schedule of when I should do some schoolwork and when I could just relax for the rest of the day. Overall, the pandemic brought many challenges when it came to transitioning to in-person learning to online, and I found ways to adapt and keep my grades up despite those challenges. ",

The Covid-19 pandemic has taught us that disruptions can occur anytime in life. As such, we are to remain vigilant and always prepared to deal with life's many challenges and crises. Covid-19 has had a big impact on me. I have been affected financially, psychologically, physically, and even medically when diagnosed with the virus. Like many other students, I painfully grappled with the idea of losing the normal way of life that included attending college and not being able to experience the unique dynamics of in-class experiences. I started university in Fall 2020 with two of my greatest fears being: my family not being able to support my academics financially and getting infected with Covid-19. My Dad also lost his job during the beginning of the pandemic which affected my family financially tremendously since he has still not been able to get a permanent job. There are times when I wonder about how my family will pay for my academic expenses, however, I hang in there hoping that I will get the financial assistance needed to complete my studies in Accounting and Finance. The hope and a tenacity for quality and success have helped me attain good grades every semester. My other fear was getting infected with Covid-19, which I contracted in October 2020, even with my best efforts to protect myself. Getting infected with Covid-19 was a difficult time for me because I had severe symptoms. I remembered having to walk almost 2 miles twice during my two-week infection period, practically dragging myself with the weight of a 32-pack case of water and other necessities on my back since I could not afford a taxi or Uber ride. While my body seemed to be failing me at that time, I managed to overcome the virus by reminding myself of my career goals. Additionally, the unprecedented social distancing that came with Covid-19 greatly impacted me. My social life came to a standstill. All I had was the immediate presence of family. Our bond grew stronger, however, while my family was important, I was missing my friends. So unconsciously, I turned to a social substitute â€“ excessive eating. I gained over forty-five pounds in under three months. As the weight increased, my self-esteem and confidence plummeted. I looked and felt different. I no longer desired to be in my friends' company. My self-image was compromised. However, my spiritual upbringing was my saving grace since it provided self-realization. This experience has also allowed me to develop a renewed commitment to daily exercise. There is absolutely no doubt of the wide-range impact of Covid-19. Like others, I was not spared from its brutal force. However, I am grateful that although I was battered by Covid-19's dreadful might, I was able to bring out from within me, even greater overcoming strengths, and being the best me in these difficult times.",Yes

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my mother was struggling to find work.  Being a mother of a single-parent household, she used all the money she has saved to keep our family afloat.  Her savings continue to dwindle.  So much so, that I witnessed her scrap up all the money she could to pay bills and the living cost of two children. I knew that I had to do my absolute best to help her.  I stepped up to help and was able to combine my income with her limited income.  I was able to help pay rent and utilities by working 38-hour weeks, while also attending Fisk University virtually at the peak of the pandemic.  Fortunately, I was able to maintain straight As in all of my courses.  These courses equaled 18 credit hours, the maximum course load that Fisk University offers totaling 6 classes.

Since the start of the pandemic, we were forced into isolation which left me very lonely and stressed, which lead to an increase in anxiety levels. Many people, especially in the black community often don't talk about the importance of mental health. Our environment has been suffering from a catastrophic global event for 2 years; anyone can feel stressed or overwhelmed about the situation. The best way for me to take care of my mental health meant taking up new hobbies such as painting and reading poetry books. Allowing myself to be in a state of mind of calmness and sustainability. Overcoming isolation meant understanding and acknowledging that not being able to interact with my friends consistently or going outside due to regulations and adherence to protocol was to keep the world and our environment safer. Going to college during a pandemic can be very challenging as well, this meant engaging with my professors and peers through a virtual setting to continue forms of communication and education. Many of us individuals took for granted what it meant to meet in-person with our families, friends, or professors over coffee, chatting about life until we were stripped of that ability. Mastering how to learn in a different environment meant: how to time manage efficiently, stay organized, and focus while in a distracting environment. This made me appreciate the friendships that I had even more and appreciate those family members who called to check up on me on WhatsApp because you never know whether you're going to see them again or hear their voice. One zoom call or FaceTime during the pandemic was the most comforting experience to have to know that you're not alone in this situation, that everyone is suffering at the same time. COVID has taught me a great deal and has challenged me lots, but it has made me a better person today.

Moreover, paying air-fare and baggage fees to losing opportunities such as leadership programs and internships due to the pandemic was depressing.   Truth be told I have been working superbly from the earliest starting point with the effect of this emergency by transferring to virtual channels and adapting to the ""new norm"" environment. This scholarship will push me closer to my Accountant Profession. As the commitments I'm willing to make as an Accounting Professional to achieve change inside the network are powerful, inconceivable and extraordinary. This scholarship will help my dreams become reality by Teaching the importance of financial literacy which is something I've always wanted to do. Also, pursuing my career in either internal audit or taxes.  Initially, Teaching the Importance of Financial Literacy will permit people to know about their monetary position. A not-revenue driven association can be built permitting individuals to learn valuable material to improve their capacity monetarily. Consequently, when the association is for nothing out of pocket, individuals living in the public arena ought to partake in this chance. Budget reports comprehensive of pay articulation, proclamation of proprietor's value and monetary record would be a stunner for society. Classes that show people how to plan, will set them up for crises, for example, catastrophic events, fire and downturn. For as far back as years, downturn has negatively affected numerous individuals. It's preventable however a few people may suspect something. At long last, cons of having protection will be a critical factor in cases recently referenced. As an Accounting Professional giving society the rights to hold their key to Financial Literacy is a significant part.   Hence, my interest in internal audit vocation is procured from being able to critically think, analyze situations and problem-solving. Internal auditors are responsible for monitoring the procedures of a corporation.  Therefore, working proximately with managers sanctions them to give input on financial statements and internal controls of the company which sparked my interest.  I like being challenged and able to voice opinions predicated on something that is scarcely erroneous. Therefore, probing for mistakes that can preserve the company initially is a tremendous task.  Internal audit is an intricate field and only strong minded individuals can take on sensitive cases.  Hence, monitoring operations, assessing internal controls and reviewing are vital for an internal auditor that I'm ebullient about.

At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, I was in the process to prepare for graduation and transition to College. Everything became uncertain and challenging in just a couple of weeks.  I had to attend orientation and register for classes online by myself. It was difficult to reach out to the registrar or my advisor to plan the academic year. When I had a question, it was hard to get a quick response, and every time I tried to call the office, there was no one to answer the phone. I was able to manage those challenges by reaching out to students that provided me advice and guidance to be successful. I created a new plan to stay organized and manage my workload. During the pandemic, I attended the  NABA Student Conference. During my senior year in high school, I learned about NABA and the conference through my sister. She went to two ERSC and told me about how her experience was. Since then, I got interested in joining the Association and was excited to take part in this amazing opportunity. During my freshmen year of college, I got the chance to attend the first virtual NABA student conference. It was an overwhelming yet great experience. I got to network with professionals, get to learn about different business career fields. Even if I did not get to lend an internship for the following summer, I created new relationships with professionals that became my mentors. At the beginning of my second year of college, I also participated in the ERSC and due to my network experience, I was able to get accepted to a Crowe leadership program for May and also lend an internship with Deloitte for this summer. For the next few years of my college journey, I am looking forward to learning more about NABA and all the opportunities that they give. Lastly, I am already excited about what I can learn from this experience. ",

From academia to the household, every aspect of our lives have been affected by this airborne interruption. Not only has Covid-19 taken things away, it also forced us to implement unfamiliar technology in to our societies. Once-busy streets became abandoned and homes appeared occupied. City offices turned off their lights during the week and new ""home offices"" were created. Classrooms collected dust while Zoom became the new method of daily communication. Among other things, my voice and confidence left as well.  This pandemic took away my confidence in public speaking. Leaving the classroom to then enter its virtual counterpart was, in my opinion, a terrible experience. For the first time I actually appreciated waking up, driving to school, going through the extensive process of finding a parking spot, and sitting through a lecture with other students falling asleep. This goes to show you never really appreciate something until you no longer have it. We had Zoom now. Which meant we had a video lecture where everyone's cameras are turned off. Everyone is hiding, no one is taking risks, and few people are learning.  After the pandemic had settled and we could return to the classroom I felt out of place. The halls I used to comfortably navigate, I now felt as if I no longer knew. I was timid in my lectures, and I never dared to raise my hand. I didn't think I had a voice. Fast-forward to my meeting with our NABA chapter's faculty advisor and UTK faculty senator Dr. Hart. She noticed I wasn't participating as much as I previously had and she inquired further. Even though I couldn't see it, she was convinced she could see the power and the influence my voice brings to a group. Her goal was for me to learn how to present my voice in the classroom so I could then project my voice in the boardroom.  Fast-forward with me again. After much preparation, coaching, and public speaking practice my professors began to take note. Shortly after, I was invited to give a speech to the AIM Advisory Round Table Meeting. This was an amazing opportunity where the Accounting & Information Mgt. Department hosted its investors, educators, and university partners to hear what is happening in our college from the perspective of an undergraduate student. Although I was nervous, I was able to confidently deliver my message and point of view to a group of individuals whom I sincerely revered.

Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, I was enjoying my senior year of high school. As time went on my optimism dwindled and I was faced with the reality that I wouldn't be leaving my town for a very long time. The first major plan that was halted was visiting Indiana University. I took a leap of faith and decided to accept my admission into IU despite never having been to Indiana, and to move there from Texas in the middle of a pandemic. However, I couldn't anticipate the even bigger challenge the pandemic would present me with: my mental health. I fell into a depression dwelling on things I couldn't experience. It wasn't until my solemn 18th birthday when it dawned on me that I was officially an adult and needed to do something to restore my optimism.  I've always been a meticulous planner, and had a list of tasks to complete when I ""had the time"" that I could no longer find an excuse for postponing. First, my music. Currently I am a double major at IU, studying Accounting and Jazz Voice. But these plans to pursue voice actually came from quarantine. I had an old keyboard that I dusted off and turned to YouTube videos. I retaught myself chords, scales, and eventually was able to accompany myself for different songs which led me to my next goal: creating a music page. I've always wanted to put my music online but hesitated out of fear of embarrassment. So one night I spent hours working on what would be my first post for my music page. After it was up, the support I received astounded me and I remained motivated to become the person I always hoped to be as a young adult. Still struggling with my mental health, I wanted to create something more tangible: a garden. I purchased seeds, shovels, fertilizer, and soil. In the summer of 2020 I started my little garden and was proud of the life I created. I spent a lot of time in my garden writing lyrics, reading books, listening to sermons, and finally processing the events of my life. My last goal was something I had been ignoring despite it being right in front of me: a crochet hook sitting on my desk. So I returned to YouTube and learned how to crochet. I made beanies for my family and friends, a scarf for my mom, and both for myself when I learned that it snowed in Indiana.   All of these things greatly helped me to improve my mental health throughout the pandemic, and prevented me from dwelling in fear and unbelief. Now a sophomore at IU, I still crochet and write lyrics to relieve stress, I have succulents in my room to keep my garden alive in spirit, and I'm becoming the person I hoped to be more and more each day.

I am currently a senior, on track to earn a bachelor's in accounting. I need financial assistance because I am a single mother without a support system to contribute to my education. In fact, mother abandoned me at the age of 16, with nowhere to go which left me homeless for a short period of time. I still have not had any communication with my mother nearly 11 years later. My father lives in Georgia and we from time to time but not as often as a typical parent and child should.  I am getting this degree on my own. Although my mother has no communication with family, it is my understanding that she is battling depression and anxiety. With my mother's mental health issues and not being a part of my life, I am without a support system. I have tried to reconnect with my family, but my family want nothing to do with me because of my mother. This is because my mother isolated me and told me horror stories about my father's side of the family. I do not have any type of  relationship with my father's family. and my father and I to have a very distant relationship. I would not describe myself as having a positive childhood or teenage life. Being raised in a negative home with a negative person caused me to not see a positive outlook in life as child and teenager. As a teenager, I worked a full-time job while a freshman in high school at McDonalds and Taco Bell. I was unable to enjoy the normal, happy teenage life because all I did is work.  My mother's issues have helps me realize what it takes to be a better mother then her and that I want the best for my child.  That why I'm in college. I want my child to be able to have a normal childhood and teenage life. To live in a stress free and positive home that he would love to come home to everyday.

A challenge I had to face during the Covid-19 pandemic was adhering to curfew and restrictions while on winter break in my native country, Barbados. This curfew and multiple restrictions hindered me from attending social and cultural events and from fully participating in athletics. However, through creativity and innovation, I was able to triumph. Firstly, having to cope with a country-wide curfew was new to me as my idea of having a curfew was for times of rest. So, being prevented from leaving home between the hours of 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. was upsetting. This curfew affected the hours of commerce, and many businesses began closing much earlier than usual. Further, if you had to conduct any personal business, you could only complete it on certain days based on your surname. To manage these drastic changes and nightly restrictions, my family and I would use our designated days to conduct business and to take scenic drives through the countryside. I took pictures and videos of beautiful sites which helped me cope with the stress of having to remain at home so much.   Secondly, the curfew and the accompanying restrictions affected people mentally. Personally, these restrictions left me feeling a little imprisoned at home. I could not attend any social or cultural events as these were either prohibited or restricted to very small numbers in the case of funerals or weddings. To cope with not being able to socialize, some people organized parties whether birthday or otherwise using Zoom. As a result, I was able log in and join in the celebrations. For funerals, however, following the service via Zoom was not the same as being there in person. So, I had to be intentional about celebrating a loved one's life and being an encourager to family/friends in mourning.   Thirdly, the Covid-19 pandemic caused the cross-country, indoor, and outdoor athletic seasons of track and field to be cancelled at Saint Augustine's University. On top of that disappointment, I returned home to restrictions on athletic training. People were restricted to exercising only on their own property, initially. Then, this limitation was relaxed to allow exercise in public areas for groups up to four, if you were not from the same household. To follow the rules but stay physically fit, I along with other athletes, would go and train during mornings from 6:30 to 8:30 a.m, before the 9 a.m. daily rush began.  In conclusion, Covid-19 brought some challenges to life as I knew it. However, with some creativity and innovation, I was able to overcome the barriers (i.e., curfew, restrictions to movement, mental pressures, and athletic training limitations). My outlook on life is stronger, and I'm encouraged to creatively press through every hinderance and uncertainty the  Covid-19 pandemic brings.  ",Yes

It has altered our way of living and has resulted in us adapting to many new ways of life. Over the last couple of years, the pandemic has caused many issues including financial burden, affecting many people's mental health, physical health, etc. However, personally for me the main factor that took a toll on me was having to adjust to taking online courses not only at the end of my high school career, but also leading into my college career. I'm sure many students can relate, but if anyone else is like me, I cannot focus by looking at a computer screen constantly. It makes it tough to obtain the information that my professors throw at me. My attention span gets really short, which causes me to zone out a lot during classes. This resulted in me having to reteach myself the information after classes in order to stay on track. On the other hand, college is already a tough battle on its own. Having to adjust to that new environment, on top of getting used to what became the new normal, the virus, really put a lot of pressure on me. I felt weighed down a lot of times trying to balance it all. Another significant impact that the pandemic has had on my college experience is meeting new people. Without question, I am thankful for the people I have met despite the circumstances. However, I feel like I could have met many more people if the circumstances were different. It has made it difficult to meet people because a lot of people were and still are scared to come out because of this life-threatening virus that surprised us all. Many were/are not willing to take the risk in coming out in order to protect their families and loved ones, which is completely understandable. All in all, COVID has contributed to some of both the good and bad that has taken place over the course of three years for me. It has forced me to build relationships with my professors in order to get as close to an in person experience as possible. Not only that, it has led me to landing internships in my career area. Even though some good came from this pandemic, some factors that have negatively affected me still continue to do so to this day, with the number one thing being STRESS. ",

However, the impact and its consequences are different depending on our status as individuals. Some people were hardly trying to understand what was happening while others try to adapt to working remotely, ordering food online and homeschooling. I felt all this but I overcame it. I was working as a troubleshooter and was very active socially. Traveling and going out on the weekends were my ways of resetting myself. Basically, I am not a the type of person who enjoy being at home. I used to be fulfilled and happy just with fresh air. However, I had to face many challenges during this lockdown period. These were the most emotionally difficult times. What I found most tiring was the uncertainty about the future. I have always known from the events of my life that nothing is uncertain. But I didn't know how deeply everything changes from one day to the next.  I was facing limiting direct contact and travel restriction . Simple things such as greetings our friends or people that meet became an issue. Simple things such as a me time at my favorite restaurant in town became a problem. While I was processing with that, the monotony has warmly settled in my apartment.  I am being sarcastic about it, but at the time, it was the most overwhelming time. Staying at home is one of the easiest things you can ask of someone. But when it comes to an obligation. It feels like a prison. And that's how I felt. Working from home, spending all your time communicating with friends and family by phone or video call became a struggle. Even going grocery shopping which is often a chore was something that I missed a lot. I could not stay like this for long since I did not know when I will be able to get back to my lifestyle. I decided to leave this loop and face the problem.  I had to adapt, create, innovate to evolve. I accepted the new lifestyle and start learning to do everything remotely. With the evolution of technology  and social media, I was able to maintain my lifestyle but remotely. For instance, I was ordering food online, creating social events such as trivia on zoom, organizing movie night through teleparty to watch on Netflix with family and friends, adapting my work out without equipment at home. And all this has helped me to become a better version of myself, a resilient person. A person who bounce back from adversity and flexible. I only take positive things from this period of my life. I believe that nothing happen by chance and if you manage to create something good out of something, that's the most valuable part of it. ",

There wasn't help and resources out there at the time, so I was left to use my own resources to understand the readings and assignments. I struggled to take mental breaks, especially because I was not actively going out and meeting people, along the line it took a toll on my health physically and I was stuck between having appointments with doctors and juggling my schoolwork. At the time, hospital visits were not the best, because the world was scary. The summertime of 2021 was the toughest, my family was unable to keep up with rent, so we had to move from Chicago to the suburbs during this time, moving was extremely difficult and things were more expensive at the time.

The impact of the pandemic and perspectives are felt differently for each individual.   In December of 2020, my sister tested positive for COVID-19. My family and I were very surprised by this because she rarely left the house as she did online school. She initially experienced symptoms that were uncommon to COVID-19 so my family and the doctor did not think it was the virus. Her doctor tested her to check all possibilities, and the result came back positive . Unfortunately by this time, my sister was already in contact with all members of the household. My mom soon began experiencing symptoms and tested positive as well. This was of great concern, as my mom has several underlying health conditions. Simultaneously, I began experiencing symptoms, during the week of final exams.  I initially took two covid tests, which both resulted negative, which my doctor found hard to believe. As days went on, my symptoms worsened, and eventually I was sent to the hospital. My test results at the hospital were also negative . I still vividly remember the doctor shrugging his shoulders saying, ""Your mom and sister tested positive,and you have the symptoms so we'll just basically say you have Covid."" I was sent home that night still with many medical difficulties. As the days passed in the week, my symptoms worsened at one point reaching a 104 degrees fahrenheit fever, and difficulty breathing. My family was very fearful and I was sent back to a different hospital. I was reluctant to go, knowing the first doctor told me there was not much I could do. Being it was Christmas Eve, the hospital had a three hour wait. By the time I saw the doctor, it was hard for me to speak. He ran several tests, including a Covid-19 test which came back negative again. Finally, he discovered that I had double pneumonia, which is a life-threatening infection that causes the air sacs to be filled with fluid. Symptoms of this infection are very similar to Covid, which made it difficult to identify what caused me to be ill . After five negative Covid tests, I am so grateful that the second doctor made sure to check for other possible causes of being sick and was able to prescribe antibiotics.If we went with the moral story from the first doctor, that I simply had Covid despite the negative results, I do not know if I would be here today.   As I am grateful to be alive and fully recovered,  this experience has truly made an impact in my life. It has changed my perspective on the choices I make both professionally and personally. Currently I serve as the Corporate Relations Director for Rutgers WomenBuild, a Mentorship Assistant for GearUP, and a student ambassador for Prudential Financial.I look forward to graduating college in January 2023 and becoming an IT Project Manager at Prudential Financial.

Before Covid-19, I had just moved to my highschool at the beginning of my junior year and joined a few different clubs. One of the clubs I joined was the Black Student Union(BSU) as a member. I quickly built relationships in the club and was selected to be treasurer. I then saw how I could expand and grow the organization, ultimately leading me to become Co-President my senior year. With all of the social unrest and negative stories about law enforcement, I decided to bring an experience I had while attending the FBI Teen Academy in Louisiana to my school in Maryland. I learned how you were supposed to act during an encounter with the police. More importantly, I learned what the police are thinking and how they are trained to interact with the public. I wanted all students to have this experience, which is why I decided to spread the message to students in BSU at my new high school.   Since this was the first big event that my club hosted since we had been virtual, there were a few challenges that I faced. One of them being a video that was going to be shown during the presentation. I first consulted with my parents and then spoke to the presenter to get their thoughts on the matter. The input I received helped guide me to my decision and recommendation to the club sponsor, who held the final decision authority. There were also some technical problems that occurred right before the event, but I was able to think of ways to work out those problems so that we would not have to delay the event. I knew that if we were to delay the presentation, it might not end up happening for months.   In the end I was able to organize and host a presentation by the Head of the FBI Civil Rights Unit in Washington, DC to come and speak to my club. The presentation provided valuable information that helped give students another perspective of law enforcement and tools to keep them safe during potential law enforcement encounters. The presentation was an open conversation between club members and the presenter. Although this was my first time inviting, hosting, and organizing an event by myself. I was able to delegate to other BSU officers to assist me with creating a flyer, taking notes during the presentation, and organizing, and inviting someone from the school newspaper to attend the meeting.    My leadership positions have taught me to work hard, do the right thing, give back to the community, and let my actions speak for themselves. I plan to continue putting into action what I have learned so far. I look forward to my future journey and appreciate consideration for being accepted for the National Association of Black Accountants Scholarship.  ",

When universities were forced to transition to distant, remote learning, it was my ability to adapt and make use of the resources at hand that I was able to successfully navigate my studies.  First, I had to create a professional learning environment in my childhood home, a place that was always juxtaposed with resting, comfort, and easygoing living. It was not a seamless transition and for about a month's time, I had given in to distractions and lack of motivation. A wake-up call came in the form of my younger sister when our county's public schools were forced into online remote learning as well. Because our parents' roles in the federal government were deemed necessary, I had to be the disciplined one in keeping us both on track in our studies and it's common knowledge that children model the behavior they see. Since I wanted my sister to do her best and prioritize her education, it meant I would need to make and take that effort to prioritize mine.  For many people, the pandemic also brought mental health and emotional and social wellness to the forefront and I was no different. As I stated earlier, I had to deal with resisting distractions and utilizing self-discipline when I lacked motivation. I also acknowledged for the first time that the things I was doing in my life were not bringing me happiness or lasting joy.  When I would hear stories about someone who was suddenly healthy one minute and within a span of three days gone from this earth, it would really make me evaluate what I was doing and my personal why. Why was I majoring in computer science? Why did people's opinions on how I should spend my time matter so much to me? Why didn't I study what truly piqued my interest and was intriguing to me? Why didn't I have enough faith, trust, and confidence in God and myself that I could stand out and be successful and thrive in the industry in which I truly wanted to be?  With all these questions in mind, I turned to prayer and for the first time the free therapy and counseling offered by my school. I was one of those people that often thought therapy was more for those with extremely distressing thoughts and emotions however, having that safe space to vent and to ponder free from judgment was an invaluable asset during the pandemic. With newfound wisdom, advice, and aid, I made the decision to switch my major from computer science to finance even though it meant pushing back my graduation date. I was also able to identify problematic thought patterns I had that held me back from pursuing the things (such as business and finance) that brought me happiness. ",Yes

I have discovered that despite difficult circumstances, there is always a way to successfully complete anything that needs to be done. Before the recent crises, I never thought about how life would be living through a pandemic. Difficult tasks and routines are now required to be executed through technology. We have all had to learn to alter our daily habits while still accomplishing what needs to be done.      During the beginning stages of the pandemic, I developed a motto that helps me get through many stressful situations. That motto is: ""It may not be your fault, but it is your responsibility."" This helps me mentally prepare for whatever challenge is thrown my way. Although many events and tragedies are unexpected and out of our control, I try to keep a positive mindset and do as much as I possibly can to make each situation better. Having the drive and the aspiration to get out of a negative situation is another way that I have chosen to lead. My eagerness to learn and to keep a great attitude is important to me. Although my peers may have been in the midst of their own personal crises, it has been my goal to try to reverse their mindset and be a positive influence.      Another phrase that keeps me motivated is, ""You got this."" This phrase makes me feel confident and positive while completing any task. Before a long day I will take a deep breath and repeat this phrase a few times. When I am confident and feeling well within myself, it is easier for me to be an inspiration for others. I've learned that what you say and what you think have a big impact on your mood and your day overall. I intentionally speak positive words and keep an energetic attitude because I know how it affects the outcome of the day not just for myself, but for other people that I may have the privilege to interact with.

I remember seeing my first article about COVID-19 when I was in high school before it reached the United States. I read the article and kept going on about my day because I didn't think it was something that would affect me or our country. I had no idea that just a month and a half later, my entire life would be changed from that moment on to now in the present where I am still experiencing changes.        From that moment on, COVID-19 taught me how to adapt to how my life and the people around me could change in an instant. I grew up as a person who had every single thing organized down to the T. I knew exactly how my high school career was going to go, how college would be, all the things I would do in college, and my career once graduating from college. All of that changed when COVID-19 came. At the time, losing my chance to graduate seemed like the hardest thing I had ever faced. It was a day I dreamed of for so long and I wanted it to be perfect but instead, I got a letter from my school saying for the safety of everyone, the graduation would be delayed until a safe date was determined to proceed. That was the first time in my life I had to really learn how to adapt to situations that didn't work out the way I had planned everything to go.       A lot of my friends like to call me OCD because they say I'm one of the most organized people they know. Having this capability of organization is a strength as well as a weakness and COVID-19 helped me realize that. COVID-19 made me gain the strength I needed to adapt to changes and not break down under pressure because my plans had to change. I was so set on the way I had everything planned out that I thought if anything messed up, there was no way around fixing it. I now know, there is always a way to fix a problem or situation if I just take the time to acknowledge the change, assess the alternatives, and choose the best way to keep moving forward on my path.

I didn't know then how my life would be changed by Covid 19 or all that I would have to overcome, but looking back I'm grateful.  	Junior year is the year that college recruiting happens.  My times were increasingly impressive, my grades were excellent and my standardized test scores were above average.  I felt like my dreams were about to come true and then our track meets began to be canceled and ultimately the season was canceled.  I lost an entire year of making myself better in a way that others could notice.  Like most, I pivoted from the classroom to home school, but to stay in shape with all public facilities getting shut down, my outdoor workouts were just me and a trainer and my parents had to convert our garage to a weight room.  I became stronger and faster with no one to race, but myself.  So when I received the call to be a peer teacher at the Legacy Centers Virtual Academy I thought that it would be a good way to be around others (with masks of course) and make the time pass faster.  	At The Legacy Center, I was placed over middle school students.  I grew up a lot having to help others. This job opened the door for me to work during the summer as a Peer Mentor for the Huntsville Housing Authority's Encampment Program for boys in foster care and those considered to be ""at-risk"".  Again, I learned so much about myself and about serving others.   	 	My problems, specifically not being able to put up better times, became smaller as I got to know people my age who had very little, but many of them had a lot of hope.  I overcame many challenges during Covid 19; the death of my Great Aunt, no track season my Junior year, and my fear of an uncertain future.  But I believe that the most significant thing that I overcame was my belief that I'm the one totally in charge of my life.  Covid 19 taught me that sometimes when things seem like they are falling out of place they are really making us better people and falling into place.  I started running for myself; each time to beat my last best time.  I had a dream one night that I was giving a press conference about choosing to run at Jackson State University.  I woke up and told my mom the next morning.   Although at that time no coach had called, I had not applied for the school or had any intention of attending JSU.   Within the next month, I was being interviewed by a reporter for Fox54 about my decision to sign a track scholarship and attend JSU, majoring in accounting.  I'm still running.  Running to overcome anything that keeps me from where Destiny has for me to be.  ",

The student who did well but spoke little, so my talents and hard work weren't always recognized. Many times, it was only when I had no choice, that was when I truly started networking and openly sharing ideas, which often only happened in face-to-face discussions. So, as you can imagine, it was a difficult transition when school became virtual, and I was now in a place where networking was through a screen and many companies no longer had the opportunity to meet students in person. At the beginning of the pandemic, I knew I wanted to earn an internship and I knew I would have to network with peers, professors and professionals on LinkedIn. So, I made it my goal to set up 1 on 1 calls with everyone that I could, I reached out and formed relationships that turned into mentorship and through these sessions, receiving advice and doing my own research I was able to build up my confidence. From there, I realized that I belong to all these spaces as much as my peers do and I started to realize the value I can add to any environment. Through that, I applied for internships that interested me and practiced my interviewing skills which helped me overcome my timidness as a student. As a result of that, by the time my second semester in Covid came around, I was networking with many recruiters, my interview skills improved dramatically, and I was able to earn an internship with one of my dream companiesâ€”Apple. The pandemic undoubtedly will have a lasting impact on all our lives, and because of it many of us have developed and become more resilient.

This challenge is further heightened as I have enveloped myself in these communities assuming leadership positions. As if not having enough hindrances already, Covid-19 drastically complicated my ability to network and expand my leadership skills due to the limited number of opportunities to do so.  Covid-19 created a virtual interaction environment that made it difficult to build relationships, coordinate events on campus and to develop as a leader. One of the positions I began during Covid-19 was becoming a Peer Mentor for the BizEdge mentoring program for the Tippie College of Business. I had the privilege of participating in the program as a mentee during my freshman year, and I genuinely appreciated and enjoyed my experience. This program helped me to assimilate into life as a new student on a college campus. However, during the virtual atmosphere created by Covid-19, as a mentor I found it very difficult to develop a relationship with my mentee. Most meetings we had were through zoom, and it was almost impossible to replicate the welcoming feeling and environment that had been created for me. However, I made the most of these virtual interactions and tried to be as engaging as possible. Over time, I learned that my mentee and I shared some commonalities. For example, we both enjoyed working out, so we began to go the gym together once the recreational center reopened. Eventually, we were able to develop a successful mentor-mentee relationship. and formed a friendship as well. I even inspired and encouraged him to join me in working as a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Ambassador for the Tippie College of Business, as a Coordinator for the Black in Business Series.  Although Covid-19 impacted my ability and the number of opportunities to develop as a leader, I learned to adapt, be flexible and navigate within the new norm.

Personally, having to physically distance myself from people I care about like my family, friends, colleagues at work, my religious community was a tough one for me. My job routine was deeply affected because the work from the home policy of the organization I worked for in 2020 required we attend to issues as they arise which technically meant that we were on duty all round the clock.

Covid-19 crisis forced companies, schools, and organizations to pivot and redirect the way they conduct business. Consequently, that has impacted my life as well.  As a student, I had to take online classes for the first year and a half at the college that I had freshly transferred to. This was not what I have had envisioned for my college. I was new to the college and online classes were a barrier to a smooth transition to this new environment. As a student who likes to physically interact with students and professors, being stuck behind a computer's screen for the majority of the day was not ideal.

Although it was not what I hoped for, I tried to get the best of a situation that is beyond my control.  Working as a stocker in a retail company, I was fortunate enough to still have kept my job despite the pandemic. With a tight schedule of being a full-time student and working about 25 hours a week, I had to be better at organizing and managing my time.  Prioritizing my tasks became essential. In that regard, I started using a daily schedule planner filled out with all the daily tasks I have to complete (homework, work, and other errands).  Every night before I go to bed, I already have my next day schedule planned and written down. I made that habit a routine and kept going ever since. I believe it helped me tremendously juggle work and school and being active in school organizations such as NABA. While the Covid-19 pandemic affected how I envisioned my college, it definitely helped nourish skills like time management, multi-tasking.

Hi, My name is Chenelle Diedrick- an undergraduate student at Monroe College pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Information Systems.  There were many challenges that I faced during the pandemic. Perhaps the most devastating challenge was the series of events that led up to my pre-diabetic sister being hospitalized due to complications with the virus. My recollection of that time was one of the harshest in my life. Having recalled that I was the first to contract the virus in my household only amplified feelings of sorrow and stress. I remember not being able to focus on my course-work at school, wearily waking up every morning, looking out my 2nd floor window and wanting to somehow destroy my body or by some means silence the thoughts of anger, frustration and ultimate futility of my life. In a time when self-motivation was more crucial to success in the new virtual era of classes, I was lost, devoid and so clearly divested of life for what seemed to drag on for days, weeks or months of sharply shed tears and heartache. I waited, wanted and wished for my sister's recovery. How I overcame this period was nothing short of what I would call miraculous. In retrospect, I now feel I am akin to a different- albeit better person. Through the combined effort of family and mentors I started taking small steps to break the unhealthy patterns that I had been developing. Even after my sister was discharged, feelings of depression still lingered with me for many days and nights. It was only when I yielded to the advice of the people closest to me- practicing meditation and speaking daily affirmations for myself was I able to combat negative thoughts and emotions. This was perhaps one of the most beneficial habits I have ever developed. I sincerely felt and still feel that the power of daily affirmations and speaking things into being magnetizes your mind so you can pull yourself closer to the positive spectrum in life. With a few weeks of consistently practicing, focusing and speaking my daily affirmations through my mouth and into the world- I had relieved myself of depressive habits and can now see those memories as the mold that was for the stronger me. History often teaches us that challenges create character; and that adversity yields ardor. Since experiencing this account firsthand I can firmly say I now understand the importance of having someone in your life to be a mentor to or be mentored by.

If it's one thing that the pandemic taught me, its life shouldn't be all about work and school. If we don't give ourselves a break, how can we expect to function the next day at 100%? Some things that I have incorporated into my daily work balance life are exercises like yoga for my mental health, daily affirmations for positivity, limited social media to reduce insecurity, and time to enjoy life.  Around March 2020, I was faced with the challenge of completing my undergraduate semester online while mentoring college students, completing work-study hours, and adapting to a new lifestyle of being at home. As small as the issue may sound, it was one of the most challenging things I could ever do. While remote, I had to consider my home environment, technical problems at school and home, and most importantly,  my work-life balance.  As I was doing my daily college routine from home, I realized how much I lacked free time between my schedule. For example, I would go to work-study for 2-3 hours every day, go to class back-to-back starting at 8 am, attend workshops that my university hosts, keep up with extracurricular activities, and many more while completing my chores at home. There was no break for me to enjoy the nature of being at home and no mind of peace. The worst thing about the pandemic was listening to the news every day and hearing the death count and cases go up every day. Not only was my work-balance life unhealthy, but my surrounding at home was very toxic and unhealthy. To combat these issues, I decided to tackle each issue with a unique solution that would help me mentally navigate through the pandemic.  I decided to download a mindfulness app to help me do yoga at home and clear my mind at the end of the day for my mental health. I limited my work-study and mentoring hours and took advantage of any small breaks in between classes. These breaks included going outside, walking around the neighborhood with my dog, and making snacks to feed my brain throughout the day. The next thing I did was keep in close contact with my friends and limit my time on social media. Social media increased the negative view of the pandemic. Once I did the following, I chose to explore hobbies at home to keep myself busy and flowing with positivity.   Today, I remind myself how important my mental health and work balance is in my life. I graduated with a bachelor's in May 2021, and I am now exploring my master's. I am incorporating breaks and taking the necessary time to enjoy life. Let this be a reminder not to overwork yourself and establish a break. ",

Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, I have struggled in the area of giving back to my community. Before the virus hit some of the notable organizations I volunteered for included the Make-A-Wish Foundation with helping monitor scores to raise money during a fundraising cornhole tournament, Rise Against Hunger by helping pack food for sustainable community development projects all over the world, and Operation Christmas Child by packing gift boxes at the warehouse to ensure the gifts reached the kids before Christmas. Assisting these organizations made me realize the contentment you receive from helping others and guided me to continue helping people by giving me the courage to attend my first international mission trip to Guatemala. Unfortunately, in the past few months I have not been able to participate in many community service projects due to the coronavirus pandemic, but this year I will devote a percentage of my leisure time to exploring and creating new ways I could contribute to my community or college whilst living on campus. Although transportation may be a setback for me while in college, I will try my best to still help and give back to others around me. I have participated in countless community service events, some of which I have a hard time recalling. Helping people has definitely made a great impact on my life by making me aware of the hardships others may be facing. With the recent Covid-19 pandemic and the passing of my father, I find it important that I live up to his legacy by continuing to dedicate my time to helping others.

My hard work always paid off and the results showed in me being an AB honor roll student. I have always been able to overcome a challenge, and the biggest challenge that I had to face was the pandemic and virtual learning. COVID-19 caused me to switch to online classes, and it was very difficult for me since I am more of a hands-on learner. Learning math on a computer was a big part of my struggle, and it frustrated me, especially for the fact that math is my favorite subject and I have always been good at it.  My challenges and defeat ended up showing in my grades. My entire high school career, my GPA was a 4.0 and above. But due to a math class in my senior year, it dropped to 3.97. I was only a few points from graduating as an honor student with my friends, but that luxury was taken away from me. I was ashamed and embarrassed to be the only one of my friends who wasn't an honor graduate. I was also struggling with my mental health at this time because during this semester I had just lost my father to a brain aneurysm. I had to leave school for a week for this and my math teacher was the only one who did not let me take bereavement. Not letting that stop me, I sought help, and tried to understand the material while going through my issues. Coming to college I tried to learn from my mistakes, to have a better outcome. I had another math class that I felt very positive about because I had a fresh start. This class was asynchronous, but I was already having issues understanding the material. I sought help once again and that was still not enough. After speaking with my Advisors, they helped me create a plan that would benefit me most. I decided that I was going to drop out of the class and take just that class over the summer so that I would be able to put all my energy strictly into that class to potentially come out with a higher grade. Doing this saved my GPA, and my grades that semester were A's and B's with a 3.4 GPA. This taught me that I will have to fail a few times to succeed.  Me being able to keep going no matter how many times I have failed is why I am here today. I have applied for many scholarships and have not received all of them but applying for this one shows that I will keep going in hopes of success. The opportunity I receive this scholarship will show, I overcome another obstacle and took another step towards being in a better position. This money would go towards my later semesters and take away the worries of having to pay for my math class over the summer.  ",

The effect left from Covid is still playing a significant role in the struggles that are occurring today. This pandemic is leaving a huge impact on people across the world. People have had to overcome plenty of obstacles to stay content. Covid-19 has affected me as well in different aspects that I thought never would happen. One way Covid-19 has affected me is the changes that are happening in education. I was a part of the high school senior class when the pandemic occurred. In my opinion, I feel like the class of 2020 had the most challenging impacts. We were all in our last stride of high school when we got hit with Covid. In our eyes, we believed we were only going to be out of school for a couple of weeks then return to finish our senior year. Instead, we were not allowed to return to school at all! As a result of this, we had to adjust to many changes that happened such as online schooling, no interactions with peers, and being unable to depend on the resources schools provide. Everyone experienced this across the nation, but I feel for high school seniors, it left us with tremendous impacts. We weren't able to experience graduation, prom, or our last days of high school. I had to overcome these obstacles by staying focused on my end goal. My objective was to maintain my overachieving work ethic, pursue my college options, and finish the school year with excellent grades. I would be lying if I said all this was easy. It was really weird and hard to attend school through zoom classes. I know even for teachers, it was difficult because this was everyone's first year having to do this. I appreciate everyone trying to cooperate to make the rest of the school year the best we can. As seniors, we were all sad that our last day in school was unexpected. I had to overcome this saddening situation as well because no one would've thought our last day of in-person classes would have ended the way it did. Looking back on the struggles I've endured from this horrific pandemic, I am grateful for surviving with a healthy body and mindset. The pandemic also taught me so much about myself and life. It was a harmful situation but also benefited me in so many ways.  ",Yes

I transferred to Mississippi State University in June with hopes that by fall the pandemic would cease and school would return to normal, it did not. I had orientation via WebEx and my first semester classes were conducted via Zoom and YouTube videos. It was challenging trying to learn my way around the campus and adjust to the software used at the university. I felt defeated and lonely during my first semester.   Conducting class online was a challenge for both the teachers and students at MSU. Most teachers would upload prior WebEx videos as a substitute for holding class. This was helpful to a point because with this method there is no opportunity to stop the teacher and ask her to clarify what they said or get further knowledge. Emails were answered sporadically, it was extremely difficult to pay attention and retain information. As a solution to this, I was encouraged to reach out to my classmates and see if they could be of any assistance. It was intimidating at times because I had a little imposter syndrome. I felt that if I were to reach out to them I may be looked down upon or dismissed and that fear of rejection was real. I started out slow asking questions in the WebEx chat when available, then progressing to emailing my peers asking for study sessions. As a result, of those connections I made while we were online,  I was able to have a group of students I knew by the time we were back in person.   Another challenge I faced with transferring was making friends. While I was in community college there was probably 100 students staying on campus to the 300 who attended altogether. MSU was much larger and even more confusing due to the pandemic. I was trying to find community while at Mississippi State. My fall semester we were able to hold one class in person and I made sure to find someone in that class that I could relate to. She introduced me to an organization on campus called I.D.E.A.L. Woman. An organization aimed to uplift and empower minority women. These meetings soon were the only reason I was able to come on campus (due to a total shut down from the university). I was able to commune with like minded women and it was amazing. I.D.E.A.L was not the last organization that I would join. I found NABA with like minded business professionals and was able to advance in the organization and now I help plan meeting and events for our chapter. I was able to meet and befriend students who will now forever be a part of my life.   Transferring in the pandemic was difficult, from making friends, understanding professors, navigating online platforms, etc. However I was able to transition successfully. My story continues as I am now Vice President of NABA, multiple internships, and soon graduation.  ",Yes

My final year of high school was important because I wanted to study abroad in the United States of America. I had to do well in my final examinations and other international examinations like the Scholastic Aptitude Test. I was in a private school and had to stay on the school campus so I could focus on my examinations and engage in intensive tutoring. This was all good until suddenly we were all made to return to our homes as there was a virus outbreak and my school did not want to keep us in because of a possible lockdown that might keep us in school indefinitely.  Terry Brooks said, ""But much of life didn't allow for knowing things in advance, and you had to trust your instincts and common sense."" I thought the lockdown would be for a few weeks and everything would be back to normal soon. So, I took the lockdown as a short break and decided to use the time to rest and do some reading. I was wrong. The lockdown went on even after a month and slowly, I lost the drive to prepare for my examinations, and started to invest a lot of my time into watching movies and playing video games. Joining the rest of the world in adapting to the changes around us, my school started online lessons for everyone. I did not like online courses. I found it difficult to concentrate in classes as I was usually distracted by other things on the computer or whatever was going on at home during any lecture.  Fortunately, Nigeria was not affected by the coronavirus as the United States, and we were able to slowly return to normalcy. My school had us return and surprisingly, being back to school was harder than I thought it would be. I had spent so much time at home playing around that it took me some time to get back my student mindset. I disciplined myself by reminding myself of my primary goal- to do well in my upcoming examinations. I had a lot of help from my friends and teachers who encouraged me to study harder as I had only one shot at these examinations. Seeing my classmates make great efforts in their studies lifted my spirits, and once I started doing the right thing, I could also encourage my close friends to put their all into their studies. My steadfastness paid off as I got distinctions in my final examinations and passed my SAT and TOEFL exams. I also got admitted to a college of my choice in the United States. The pandemic served as a blessing in the end as it helped me form a great mindset to defeat tough times. ",Yes

These circumstances have led to heartache and feelings of being lost. I felt this same exact way when my school shut down my senior year in high school and during my freshman year of college where I was stuck in my dorm room by myself on zoom classes. Coming in to college I was hopeful because I would have a roommate that I could hang out with and that I would not be lonely. That was not the case for me I had a darker skin roommate but she did not like that I was of lighter complexion than her and moved out and I was alone again. Although that challenge broke my trust in people, I did not let that keep me down. I had one in-person class and made an effort to try to get to know my classmates. I also tried to get know my classmates over zoom but texting was a harder way to meet and interact with people. Through my persistent manner I met my best friend in college and she is still by my side till this day. Little did I know that my second year of college would bring the same challenges just with new people. Earlier in my semester I was disowned by my apartment, by a group of girls who I thought I would be able to call my forever roommates. However, one of the roommates which was of darker complexion again did not like me because of my skin color and made living there for me unbearable by turning the other roommates against me. I was defeated again and then remember that I was once at that place before in my life and instead of quitting I was persistent to people in charge of rooms that I needed my room changed and I met girls who do not care about the color of skin and like me because I am me. Once I moved in to a new apartment, I was able to focus on my grades, myself, and have a better social life. I made more connections with people that are in organizations that I am involved in. As compared to before I did not want to because my trust in people was so diminished by my past experiences. The main thing I did to overcome my challenges was I never gave up, I was persistent, and I looked past all the bad things going on such as Covid-19 and continued to grow through the difficult stages in my life. I will continue to take these life lessons with me through life. In a way I am kind of glad that I have experienced the things that I have had to experience because it helped me grow as a person.

That meant that there was no cure or treatment for it. After Wuhan, China, where the COVID-19 virus was originated from, went into lockdown in January 2020, the stay-at-home order became enforced in the entire United States in March 2020, unless an individual was an essential worker.  I was working as an accounting assistant at a school district in San Diego, CA in March 2020. All schools were closed, the learning style was changed to virtual learning, and all employees were sent home to work remotely. My morning routine was turned completely upside-down instantly. Instead of commuting in the morning, I turned on the laptop, didn't have to prepare lunch because I could eat whatever was in the fridge, and met friends and coworkers online rather than in person. I thought it was convenient and comfortable at the beginning of the stay-at-home order since I didn't have to rush in the morning to drop off my daughter at a specific time for me to be on time at work, and I was able to save time and money by not commuting. I called it a ""once in a lifetime experience."" After a few weeks, I felt isolated and depressed since I didn't see or socialize with anyone other than my family members who lived in the same house, and I didn't do any outdoor activities because meeting people outside of the house felt scary and dangerous because I didn't know what COVID-19 was. When I started to feel down, I decided to go for a run in the neighborhood early in the morning when I would have less contact with other people. I went for a 30-minute run several times a week, and that helped me feel a lot better. Then I realized that maybe some of my friends and coworkers felt the same way, so I started texting and calling people to see if they were alright with staying at home all day, to share my personal experience, and to urge them to work out if they could. Caring for myself provided me with the motivation to think about my family, friends, and coworkers. It not only strengthened relationships by encouraging individuals to look out for one another, but it also made me think of others in the community. I was thinking of all the other parents and their children who are struggling financially as a result of the stay-at-home order, and I donated some funds to a non-profit organization that supplied food and educational devices to the children who needed assistance. Caring for others instilled values, self-esteem, and, ultimately, a desire to be a successful person who can give and contribute even more to those in need. ",

I crawl out of my warm bed, brush my teeth and turn on my laptop. It's time for online class, again. The biggest challenge I have faced during the COVID-19 pandemic is learning remotely. Online courses made it very challenging to participate in class, stay engaged and develop lasting relationships with professors.       I took my first online class during the Spring of 2022. Emotionally, it was very challenging. To me, the most rewarding part of my accounting classes was bouncing off ideas with my classmates. Most students in my classes had differing views of the concepts we were learning, and this was always the source of exciting in-person discussions. Unfortunately, when my classes transitioned to the virtual space, this engagement decreased dramatically; honestly, it disappeared. Students hid behind the camera-off option on Zoom. As the professor enthusiastically called on students to answer questions or share their perspectives on the topic we were covering, she was welcomed by absolute silence. Not a word. Just crickets. My class of over 20 students often felt like a discussion between just the professor and me.        As the online class continued, the second challenge became evident. I quickly found myself getting distracted and my mind wandering around. I did not have a desk at home, and most cafes and public libraries closed during the beginning of the pandemic. Therefore, I had no option but to sit at the kitchen table to take my classes. My family and I live in a tiny apartment. As my siblings woke up and started to wander through the kitchen and prepare breakfast, It became almost impossible to pay full attention to my professors on Zoom. The second I wasn't intentional about staying focused, I got distracted.      Then, came the third challenge. It became difficult to build sincere relationships with my professors. Although many professors made office hours available online, I found it challenging to connect with my new professors and talk to them virtually. Professors, understandably, were tired of staring at a screen all day. Whenever I tried to stray into other matters outside of the course, such as their experience working in the industry or taking the CPA exam, their answers were dry and concise, lacking substance and context.      Despite how difficult online learning proved, I did not give up. I fought to wake up every morning and log on to every class. I treated every class like a timed appointment and dressed up every morning accordingly. On the hardest days, I reflected on how blessed and fortunate I was not to have to pause my studies, even during a global pandemic. Despite the initial hurdles, the pandemic made me more committed to my studies and professional development. It rooted my passion for accounting and made me more determined than ever to enter the profession. ",

For me personally, this resulted in a major setback in most of my social skills that I worked extremely hard to develop. During my first year in school the amount of anxiety I had around meeting and talking to different people was almost debilitating, but due to advice from advisors, professors, and other students, I was able to get myself out there and make connections. It was the most social growth I had experienced in my life, and then the lockdown came along with online classes. Although it wasn't apparent at the end of my sophomore year, I became very aware that my comfortability in social situations had nearly disappeared when it came time for my internship that summer. While I had maintained many of the social skills I'd picked up along the way, I was full of anxiety in every situation. I hated the feeling of that setback because it was a particularly hard situation for me to overcome and so the first semester of my Junior year, I sought to regain the ground I had loss. I started volunteering with organizations I wasn't a part of and spending more time in our student center, both things that were difficult to do at the beginning of the pandemic. I attended more events held by organizations on campus and made sure to engage as much as possible. Due to this I started to have less and less anxiety about these, but it also had the unintended benefit of forming deeper and better connections and friendships. ",Yes

On March 16, 2020, I received an email from the Office of the President stating that all courses at Howard University will not return to face-to-face instruction following Spring Break.  On March 20, 2020, I was forced to pack up my belongings in my dorm room and return home for the remainder of the semester.  In no way was I prepared for such an abrupt interruption in my studies.  As I look back at the sequence of events that got me to where I am today, I thank that abrupt interruption.   Entering freshmen year, I would have never thought I would be taking my core accounting courses in an online environment.  I constantly questioned my capabilities after receiving the email from the Office of the President.  I knew my home environment would make it extremely challenging for me to successfully complete my online courses.  It was of extreme importance for me to put my studies at the forefront and set a plan to ensure I was able to make the most out of these unprecedented times.  I said to myself ""it's always the tough, unpredictable times that test your potentiality the most.""   I was afraid.  Afraid that in the midst of me getting the hang of online courses, death from COVID-19 would hit too close to home.  Afraid that my aunt wouldn't make it to see me graduate from the illustrious Howard University.  She didn't make it.  Now I had no choice but to attend my first COVID-19 funeral through Zoom.  The mental and emotional battle I was presented with only motivated me even more to prove I can make it through the toughest times.   My devotion to excelling in my accounting courses through misfortune aligns with my underling tenacity of becoming a Certified Public Accounting.  My undergraduate experiences have prepared me well for my chosen career goals.  In studying accounting and participating in my internship with PwC, I learned that it takes a strong-willed and dedicated person to master this profession.  Interning with this company virtually has challenged me to be my authentic self in any environment.

While some dealt with stronger impacts than others, Covid has taught us all lessons that we didn't even realize we needed. Personally I have endured difficulties throughout school, day to day experiences, and not being able to see my Grandfather one last time. Covid hit during my junior year right as the most hectic months of my academic career were going beginning. SAT preps began and I signed up for my first SAT, college visits were signed up for spring break, and the hardest portion of the school year was just about to begin. Next thing my classmates and I knew without it even fully hitting us, everything was canceled. We were going to take a ""break"" from school for 2 weeks. We had some teachers telling us ""we'll be back in no time"" and other teachers knew from the moment it was announced that this was going to be a traumatic hit. To think next month it'll be 3 years of still dealing with Covid is ridiculous. Like others, I've had my moments of depression through high school online but I knew I was going to pass and graduate. Although the craziest adjustments began when college started and I had to adjust to school in person again and Covid still around. Dealing with senior year, my first job, getting my license, and the college process was something I could bear with during Covid but the idea of college had me doubtful. Being away from home, managing my time, and trying to pick a career that was perfect for me all while I could get Covid at any moment terrified me. What if I fail and everyone around me adjusts so easily? College is supposed to be an amazing experience in itself, the only stress I want is my workload and missing loved ones. While some conditions have been unbearable academically and emotionally I've crossed every bridge. Recently the hardest bridge I've come across was not being able to say goodbye to my grandfather, Aboy. Aboy raised my mother in Eritrea and made my mother and I into the women we are today. Through prayer and guidance I've learned that I can overcome anything I set my heart to. While restrictions on traveling have been hectic my mother was able to see Aboy one last time but I was not given that chance because Covid was too dangerous. The ongoing pandemic has been a challenge to us all but I am happy to be surrounded by people who have gone through similar challenges as I. Adjusting to such difficulties is one thing but to also continue to succeed throughout all of this makes me proud to say I am part of a strong generation that made it through this pandemic and could handle things so efficiently. Therefore, now I will handle things gracefully after taking time for myself to make sure I am mentally okay because self prioritization comes first. ",

Since March 2020, I haven't been able to see both of my parents because of the lockdowns and visa crisis. On top of not being able to see both of my parents, they are going through some trying times in their marriage. Next March will make two years of not seeing them and I've endured so much within the span of that time. I've celebrated some of the biggest life moments without them like my High School graduation, birthday celebrations, and moving into college. College move-in day at Mercer was a really sad day for me. Witnessing other students with their entire family and only moving in with my siblings brought all of my hardships back to mind. Covid hit our family's income hard and during the pandemic, I had to work during my senior year to contribute to the family income. As a family, it's difficult juggling three siblings' tuition needs all while keeping food on the table. I sometimes reflect on my life and feel a sense of isolation and hopelessness. I'm in a dark tunnel right now but I will surely see the light at the end. I use community service as a way to distract myself from my circumstances. Since my fall semester at Mercer, I began volunteering at a local non-profit organization in Macon giving back to the community. Every week I go in and distribute food to the needy, I create goodie bags and I also support the youth through tutoring. Community service has opened my eyes to the influx of poverty in Macon. It made me realize that even though my life is challenging, there are families worse off than mine. I've found also opening up and talking about this with a trusted adult has been tremendous to my mental well-being. Coming from a Nigerian Immigrant background, the idea of education has always been stressed. Coming to Mercer as the son of immigrants put immense pressure on me to academically succeed. I wanted to succeed in my first semester at Mercer not only for my parents but for myself. I wanted to show myself that regardless of personal circumstances I can still persevere and achieve my academic goals. Last semester I used my circumstances to motivate my success. During my study sessions, I would tell myself that im doing this to make my parents proud. I worked tirelessly the entire time and in the end, I was able to achieve a 4.0 GPA. This experience of covid taught me to truly cherish every moment you have with family. I look back at memories when my entire family was together and I miss it. You never enjoy the moment until it's gone. So currently, I make sure to call my parents as often as I can and connect with them even during tough times.

March 2020 will go down in history as the month when all the world's schools closed their doors to the public.  The rapid pace at which the world shuts down, as well as the rapid shift to distant learning and online education, has left little time for preparing both the potential risks to avoid and the potential opportunities this will bring. However, with every crisis that occurs comes deep challenges and opportunities for transformation.  The most affected area by the covid-19 virus is the education system, which has been slowed intensely by restrictive laws from the government, the establishment of social distancing, and compulsory mask-wearing.  In the absence of both clear effective guidelines and a contingency strategy concerning curriculum priority, the educational system produced a variety of optional approaches to preserve educational continuity.  As an international student from Nigeria, I was faced with a lack of physical activities and this, in turn, made it extremely hard for me to meet, build and sustain relationships in school during my first year. I was able to overcome this challenge by identifying virtual places where I can connect with fellow students or people that have the same interest as I do.  Another challenge is learning online, the main change most students experience is that a lot of classes, conferences, and seminars were moved online. This can be difficult as it is tough to stay active and involved over an extended period over a video call. But learning online also allowed me to re-watch lesson videos and I can focus on topics that I could not comprehend. it has also, shown that learning can continue through distance education, especially by digital means, without students' physical presence in classrooms. These challenges can affect various aspects of education, including the relationship between a student and a teacher, and is extremely crucial for learning. Even the greatest technologies cannot eradicate this distance between a teacher and a student. Classroom learning, therefore, remains essential.  There is a need to reduce as much as possible the damaging impact the pandemic did on learning. Hence, the need to get back on a faster, more convenient development in education through virtual learning. The pandemic also exposed how many students needed necessities for their education such as access to campus resources to complete their assignments, like libraries, computer laboratories, and campus wi-fi, but lost these essential tools when campuses shut down due to the covid-19 pandemic.  Finally, despite the struggles, I found ways to be creative and resilient, and even considered or engaged in practices that could make the U.S. education system more equitable. However, as the pandemic rages on, institutions and students continue to face challenges or barriers that are worsening existing equity gaps. Institutions will need to be creative and drive the system to embrace this opportunity to create an improved and more equitable system for today's students.         ",

At first, we thought we were just getting a small break from school. The next thing I knew, I was downloading zoom on all of my devices for class. My teachers, coaches, and pears became black screens as no one desired to turn on their cameras. I never thought I would miss waking up at 5:30 am every morning to go to school. There was no more waiting at the bus stop and getting on the school bus. I missed the social interaction aspect of school and being at the lunch table eating with my friends. I have heard people say, ""Senior year is your best year,"" but I felt like I was cheated out of the fun experiences of that last year of high school. I didn't get to go to events such as prom or homecoming. I could never go to any basketball or volleyball games that year. I missed all of the things that made school fun.  Continuing onto my college career, Covid-19 affected my ability to attend the freshman events in the fall semester. It was a week before my move-in date. I had all of my things packed, and I was ready to move in. I was excited to meet new people and start school, but that excitement slowly faded when my family and I contracted Covid from my brother (who had contracted it from his football team). I had to move in a week later than everyone else, and I was worried I would be behind on classwork and making friends. Overcoming this barrier allowed me to begin my college career focused and determined not to fall behind. It gave me a boost of motivation.

I wish things were back to normal and that I could get a refund for the time I lost, but time keeps ticking, and the world keeps turning. We have to keep fighting and pushing through day by day. We have to follow the standards by wearing masks and social distancing no matter how long we have already done it. We must stay positive and focus on the good things Covid-19 has given us. We are given so much time on our hands, and we have to use it wisely. We must take this opportunity to fix things in our lives that need fixing.

Before I attended St Mary's College of California, I participated in the Golden State Warriors Virtual Internship Conference in 2020 and again in 2021 in which I was also selected for the Women of Warriors and Black Alliance. I would not have predicted that the beginning of my first year of college would be virtual. In fact, my first year was confined to my bedroom and a second room for study. I maintained a strict schedule of attending classes virtually and studying as if I was on campus. Regardless of the circumstances, I dedicated myself to excelling without excuses. My upbringing, educational preparation, and experience in academics, sports, dance, choir, and community service helped me to optimize my online learning by listening and speaking in a virtual classroom, which allowed me to develop relationships with my classmates and professors. Unexpectedly during my return to college from Winter Break 2020, I tested positive for COVID and quarantined on campus for two weeks. I was relocated to another dorm room in isolation on campus and was not allowed to leave my room for two weeks while receiving three meals daily. I gained a deeper appreciation of moving freely without restrictions when I was confined to the same room for two weeks. However, I could understand the need for the drastic measures and compliance for the greater good and welfare of society. While it was inconvenient, I embraced my situation and applied myself to the best of my abilities. Due to the pandemic, my opportunities to gain knowledge and experience in business, finance, and accounting have been limited so I proactively sought my own opportunities. As a result, I completed the 80-hour program for the 2021 AT&T Summer Learning Academy, which enhanced my professional development with training in finance, human resources, advertising, media and technology, communication, and leadership. With a passion for business, specifically accounting and finance, I completed Accounting I & II during my first year of college. Further, I was selected for the 2021 Ernst & Young Expedition Program and 2021 NABA San Francisco Effectus Group Scholarship. I have been an active member of the Econ Society Club and Gael Women in Business and dancer in the Saint Mary's College Dance Company. Most recently, I was selected for the Management Leadership for Tomorrow College Prep Program (MLT). I make a difference in my community and beyond by respecting myself and others with dignity. By leading by example with consistency, humility, and dedication, I learn and share my knowledge with others through education, work, clubs, church, dance, and community service which embodies NABA's mission to ""lifting as we climb."" This is a lifelong reciprocal process that I actively seek to help others as I have been helped.",

The story of a young African determined to pursue his life-long dream of furthering his education in the United States of America came to a halt. I have been eager to attend graduate school since 2018. This dream was never realized because upon getting admitted for two (2) consecutive academic years ago, I was not able to attend because of cost. As a determined young African, I persisted by applying for admission again, and fortunately, this time around I landed a scholarship in the form of a graduate assistantship. The sad part of this story transpired when due to the ongoing global pandemic, the US Embassy in Ghana shut down operations in response to the global crisis.  I waited patiently as I explored my options and the embassy decided to roll out very limited emergency visa appointments. As if that was enough because after I have gotten my request for an emergency visa appointment approved I waited for months without getting a slot to schedule my F-1 student visa interview.  With that proving tricky, I had to raise funds to enable me to travel to Cote D'Ivoire, a neighboring West African country to undertake my visa interview and finally approved for a student visa to study in the United States of America.  My story which has inspired many out there in Ghana resonates with the words of an unknown author who states that ""every accomplishment starts with the decision to try"" and I am so proud of myself for taking this bold step of visiting a foreign country for my student visa interview.

This was not the ideal college experience. As for me, the pandemic has affected every aspect of my life - especially against the family.   The COVID-19 crisis has disparately harmed low-income households. The amount of income entering my home was 100% below the poverty line - an annual income under $31,040 for a 5-person single-family household in 2021 and $32,470 in 2022. Finances have always been a prominent issue in the home, and as a result of the ongoing pandemic, it has only made situations more complicated. Alongside me, my mother has also gone through many challenges and barriers during the pandemic. With no educational background, many employers don't seek her as a potential candidate; in turn, she's left to work in low-paying jobs. It's nowhere near enough to support all four of her children. It gets me very emotional seeing her struggle in challenging situations, especially with our experience in losing a family member in 2020 due to COVID. It started to seem that everything was falling apart, and there was no solution to my case. However, amidst all the hardships, I continued with my career path. I understood that there was a dream I still had to achieve.  I currently serve as the President of the Florida Atlantic University (FAU) chapter of the National Association of Black Accountants (NABA). This relatively new student organization has approximately 90 members, mainly due to my and others' enthusiasm. While COVID has dramatically slowed down attendance, I am working diligently to rebuild the live participation that will resume in the Fall of 2022. Regarding academic performance, my current cumulative grade point average is slightly below a 3.4 average. While this average is a little lower than other applicants, I genuinely believe my grades would have been much higher if not for COVID. As I mentioned, my mother makes a modest living, so I had to make arrangements to work to help support the family and step up to help the younger siblings with online learning. This significant responsibility has challenged many women during the pandemic, often at the cost of career progression. Given these additional pressures and responsibilities, I commend myself for not only staying in school and earning good grades but engaging as a leader in various accounting organizations. ",Yes

First, is that tea is a cult. Consider this: everyone who enjoys drinking tea swears it's the best thing ever; everyone who does not swears it's the devil, with no in between. I have to say however, that I say this mostly of Western tea. It is bland and uninviting (as are most cults), and no one really knows where it comes from or how it ends up in your shopping bag; it creeps up on you (like a cult).  If you haven't gathered yet, I dislike tea in general. Nonetheless, at the bottom of my drawer sits a tall jar filled with tea bags. As is customary for any Kenyan leaving the country, I brought tea with me. Sometimes I reach for it and take a tea bag from the jar. I've only had two cups since I arrived. Like I said, I am not a fan of tea.  But there's more to it.  I drank my first cup of tea as soon as I arrived. I'd been in New York City for about a week and was feeling very disconnected from home. So, I brewed myself a cup of Kenyan tea to soothe my insides. It worked, for a while. Then the throngs of life hit me, and I went a long time without drinking another cup. 1 month to be exact. I had Kenyan tea for the second time two days ago.  Finally.  You see, before the wake of the pandemic in 2020, my world had already been turned upside down. My dream to study in America had been violently squashed. I had applied to 10 different schools with no success. It's a difficult thing, to come to terms with rejection. Aching rejection. The kind that drowns you in a sea of misery. The kind that tells you your best was never good enough. But in the most ironic of ways, the pandemic gave me a new lease of life. It gave me time. And time was really all that I needed to get myself together again. To believe in myself again. To save myself.  And so, I applied once again during the pandemic, this time with even greater tenacity, and much better SAT scores. I put everything on the line; my education, my mental, physical, and emotional energy, the hopes, and dreams of my family and most importantly myself. And it paid off.  03/27/2021 marks the date the trajectory of my life changed forever.   Receiving my Syracuse University offer letter was a testament of my bravery and grit. Now on the floor of my college dorm room, I think about that cup of tea I had the other day. It marked an occasion of sorts. Covid 19 forced me to break with the past and imagine my world anew. It was a portal, a gateway between one world and the next. And now that I'm here, my dream to study in America is alive and well.  ",Yes

Since the beginning of this ever-non-ending pandemic, I have strived to adapt to the dynamism and make use of technological advancement to overcome circumstances that have become stumbling blocks to my education, career, and community progress.  	There was a need for protection for frontline caregivers when the pandemic began; therefore, LDS Charities partnered with other healthcare centers in Utah to make clinical face masks for healthcare workers. Because I wanted to help reduce the risk of infection, I adamantly signed up as a volunteer. Although I followed sewing instructions, I still broke a few sewing machine needles and made mistakes in folding the sheets due to my lack of sewing skills. Nevertheless, I pressed on to make fifteen masks a day, and in five weeks, I had produced five hundred covers deployed to care centers. Seeing how the pandemic has affected the lives of thousands, either sick or dead, volunteering to provide masks to healthcare workers and communities was a huge blessing to my life and the life of others. People felt more comfortable going about their essential things, such as grocery shopping and walking their dogs in masks.  	In addition to actively helping provide masks for people in my community to live everyday life, I have had to be creative in overcoming the challenges triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic outbreak, I was known for helping students run business analytics and accounting tools such as QuickBooks, Tableau, and Excel, properly do bank reconciliations, prepare error-free financial statements, and manage accounts payables and receivables. This required me to work alongside the accounting faculty on campus for students' progress. However, it became impossible to meet with students during quarantine. To overcome this obstacle created by the pandemic, I started using Zoom to connect with my student and later made a YouTube account to post detailed tutoring on essential topics. Today, my video tutorials have been viewed more than forty thousand times (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHiO2mdweKDgIxXJkrrFfaQ/about).            Through that online interaction with students and other professions, I came across The Institute of Management Accountants (IMA). After learning about the IMA, I said, ""we need a chapter here in this school."" The values and ethics of IMA would help us make strategic decisions in both our personal and professional lives. I am currently the President of the IMA chapter in my school and have passed part one of the Certified Management Accountants exam.          Looking back, I do not regret taking advantage of the technological advancement to post tutorial videos online, something I enjoy doing, and associating myself with the Institute of Management Accountants. I am bringing the same spirit of quickly adapting change to the National Association of Black Accountants to help members be strategically capable and add value to the association and their communities.

In my previous years of high school I was very successful in person. I could truly understand the content given to me. When Covid-19 came my junior year it was to be assumed that class would be easy because it would be virtual. For the rest of my junior year my school did not have a plan on how class would resume, so they gave the students one assignment each class that would be turned in by the end of each week. With that in mind, I thought the rest of my high school career would be exactly like this, and I would end it with all A's. Unfortunately, I was only partially correct about that. I received all A's, but it was extremely difficult to obtain it. The start of my senior year my school started using zoom, which at first sounds good because I actually get to learn content. However, I was unable to focus on the screen. There is just something about the teacher not being physically there that made me lose focus. I still cannot find a solution to that to this day. I was also getting distracted by my phone and computer after class. I would either be on social media or watching a show on my monitor. Procrastination is a powerful enemy to overcome during the pandemic. I found a solution at home, which is to lock up my phone in a room, while I do school work. It worked for the most part, but I still have my computer to distract me sometimes. Unfortunately, I cannot get rid of my computer because I use it to work. Fortunately, it all worked out and I graduated with all A's my senior year.  Another challenge that I faced was finding and maintaining a safe job over the winter break last December. This was a challenge because of the new Omicron variant being introduced and spreading like crazy. I did not want to risk catching it and then become unable to go back to school. I could've chosen to stay unemployed over the break, but I needed the money for tuition and for personal needs. I decided to work at Barnes and Noble because of their Covid-19 protocols. They had screens at the cash registers for the cashiers, which was my role. However, the store was very busy and masks were not required for customers, so one of my coworkers caught the virus. I continued to work though, so I risked my health just to complete my goal of paying for tuition and having spending money. ",

For me, socializing meant gathering together as a family or as a group of friends, or even for events and organization. This was one of my major ways as an individual to draw strength, be motivated and grow. As an international student studying here in the US, before the COVID-19 pandemic I would travel to my home country at least once a year to visit my family who were far away from me, I would also visit friends who are here in the United States as well. We would meet up in person for picnics, games and studying. Additionally, before COVID-19 I was able to attend live social and educational organizational events such as NABA conventions and conferences for professional development, growth and Committee services programs.      During the COVID-19 pandemic, my socializing life took a whole drastic step backward. The pandemic came with so many travel restrictions that prevented me from being able to travel to my home country to visit my family. The pandemic also led to school closures which in turn brought another distance between me and most of my college friends. In addition, other organizational events such as NABA events were held remotely. Consequently, it was during the pandemic that I realized the majority of the challenges and impacts social distancing had on me. Not being able to socialize like I used too made me realize that I was not the best at digital technology. Since most parts of the world were in a lock down during that period, everyone had to adapt and create a way around digital technology to stay in touch with family and friends. It was probably not a challenge for some people, but for me then, it was a challenge, as I had to learn on my own different digital technology models to stay involved with friends and family.       Another major challenge I overcame was mental breakdown and anxiety. Not knowing where the world was heading during the pandemic, been uncertain about when I could freely meet with my family and friends in person, consequently, I began to develop anxiety and fear. Then I found the best way to overcome this, and it was adapting and learning creativity. I began to indulge myself in creative things such as sculpture and mural painting. This helped me to stay alive, hopeful and motivated all through the pandemic. Looking back at the intense lock down period, I am glad that I was able to find the good even during the bad times.

The school was shut down, the church was shut down, and I had nowhere to go but stay home. The future looked so uncertain at that time. I was a senior in high school trying to visit different college campuses to choose the best university for me. During the first week of quarantine, I saw an Instagram post by one of my favorite entrepreneurs about an online mastermind for aspiring businesspeople. The post read, ""The 100 Mastermind: Free 30-day Trial."" I immediately googled the 100 Mastermind to learn more about it. It was an online website created by multiple 7-figure businessmen, and inside of it, tens of courses ranging from digital marketing to becoming a leader. After my quick two-minute Google search, I was convinced.  Early on, I realized the vast information taught in these videos and decided to dedicate a whole notebook just for this Mastermind. I slowly finished one course at a time while taking in-depth notes and keeping my notebook organized. I easily spent 6-7 hours a day on the Mastermind, just trying to absorb as much information as I could. I felt like a sponge that has been living in the desert and was finally exposed to a water stream. Day by day, I learned about topics that I didn't even know existed, such as raising capital for a business or strategies to increase sales drastically. I was too fascinated by the amount of information that I was never exposed to before.  Together, I watched around two hundred videos in twenty different courses and took around one hundred pages of notes in my notebook. I learned about many topics including marketing, sales, how to start a business, E-commerce, and so many more! Going through the Mastermind completely changed my view on how to live my life. It enabled me to see the world from a different perspective that I did not even know existed. The moment I finished all the courses is the exact moment I realized that I had found my ultimate passion in life: business and entrepreneurship. I decided to use what I learned in the Mastermind to help my dad's business grow. I was assigned the sales manager role, which focused on increasing the company's sales and profit margin. First, I started by adding more body shop products to our wholesale business, giving a better variety to choose from for our customers. After that, I reached out to new manufacturers in China and all around the US. Doing so brought our cost down, which helped the business increase its profit margins. Along with that, I used different digital marketing strategies from the course that I watched. By implementing these lessons, I grew the business by almost doubling our customers and making the business twice as profitable as it was before the pandemic. ",Yes

I planned to pursue my Master's degree in Accounting in the United States in 2019, during which I would prepare and sit for the prestigious Certified Professional Accountant Certification. Although I was very keen on achieving this goal, sitting for the Association of Certified Chartered Accountants (ACCA) exam was my contingency plan. By 2018, I was an Internal Control and compliance officer in a local Insurance Company in Ghana. The company had its fair share of the rippling effects of the covid19. Although my salary was not significantly impacted, I however had less to save for my educational plans due to the help I constantly had to give to relatives whose incomes were directly impacted by the Covid19. Because of inadequate savings and implementation of travel restrictions, I could not pursue my Master's degree in accounting as planned. The impact of the Covid19 became more significant in 2020 when my employer lost a lot of its corporate clients. We started facing liquidity challenges and allowances were scrapped off. I resorted to my savings in making ends meet. It became evident that I was not going to have the required funds to further my education as planned. I, therefore, took up a new role as a Finance Officer in a different local insurance company. After making my financial projections, I realized it would take me about four years to raise the required funds to be able to pursue my ambition. At that point, I was tempted to move to my contingency plan (siting for the ACCA exams). I eventually deferred my admission to Texas A&M University-Commerce from Fall 2020 to Fall 2021. I could not let the impact of the Covid19 put my dreams to a halt. I emailed the program's director if the Accounting and Finance department would need graduate research or teaching assistant. He referred me to the administrative assistant, who interviewed me for the position. I believe it was not a very difficult decision for her to offer me a graduate research assistant position, since I already had published research work on Management Accounting Practices. Although the introduction of the inflows from the assistantship could not clear the deficit balance in my educational budget, the impact was however significant in making it possible for me to pursue the Masters in Accounting degree at Texas A&M University-Commerce, and also keep my hopes of getting the CPA certification, gaining a lot of professional experience, giving back to the community and pursuing my long term goal of becoming an accounting professor in a U.S University.

Merriam-Webster). Self-doubt is a barrier that I learned to overcome during the COVID-19 pandemic.  I battled with a lack of faith in myself since the beginning of high school. I set goals like attending an Ivy League, being healthy, or auditioning for a vocal solo with a huge jazz band. Immediately after I wrote these beautiful goals for myself, I would say, ""Wait a minute. No way I could ever attend an Ivy League! Or be healthy this year. I would relapse from a healthy lifestyle. My application would not make it through the first round of decisions! And I am ludicrous to want to audition for a solo in the jazz band when other soloists are better than me"". I would indulge in this vicious degradation of my capabilities and lose faith in myself. I paid keen attention to the prospects of everyone else rather than my own.  This degrading self-talk followed me into college. During NABA events and other events on campus, I held myself back from networking. I would not dare speak to the head coordinator because definitely, I would say something this working professional would find irrelevant or unnerving. I did this because of the belief that I was not enough concerning other NABA members and students who appeared to blossom while networking. Once again, I was focused on the capabilities of others and not my own; I continued to lose faith in myself. Until March 20, 2021, when Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered New York City into a lockdown. I had an epiphany. The epiphany conjured itself as a question; if a pandemic can disrupt the world at this immense scale, then it is true that anything should be possible? With this epiphany, I realized the statement anything is possible was not just a repetitive theme thousands of scholars repeated at commencement ceremonies. Nor was it just an uplifting quote used by motivators in several delivered speeches. It is true and the key I needed to defeat self-doubt.   	After an abundance of time in lockdown, I targeted my capabilities and no one else's. I developed more confidence and faith in myself. I became resilient in ending my self-doubt. I silenced the degrading thoughts with an investment in a therapist. I maintained my drive for a healthy lifestyle. I challenged myself to turn my camera on, participate, and be present during networking events. I challenged myself to apply to internships and scholarships my self-doubt stopped me from before. I completed things I believed were impossible for me; I overcame self-doubt.     ",Yes

However, amongst all the disorder, I was able to make the most out of an unhinged situation. COVID was my stepping stone into becoming the student leader I am today. 	In March of 2020, my university made the heartbreaking announcement that students would not be allowed back to campus until further notice. However, my reality became further shaken when I learned that I was elected to President of a student organization on campus called The Marketing and Management Society (MMS). 	I'd been active in this organization since the beginning of my freshman year, but the thought of presidency petrified me. My predecessor seemed to handle the job with so much ease and control, ""How am I supposed to fill her shoes?"" I wondered. And yet, I knew an opportunity like this would not come again. It took a lot of self-conviction, but I forced myself to say yes to the position. 	Now, two challenges stood in front of me. The first was how to keep an organization alive in a pandemic. My second challenge was more personal. I felt so much reluctance to pick up the baton that was handed to me. I had six other executive board members looking to me for answers I didn't have. Nevertheless, I learned that there is no growth in comfort, and there is no progress without struggle. It felt weird to hear myself give directions and trajectories at first, I didn't even recognize my own voice. But as time passed, I built slow and gradual confidence. I soon realized that I wasn't alone in my quest to keep MMS afloat during the pandemic. Learning how to leverage my connections became the key to keeping my organization afloat. Other student leaders, professors, mentors, and professionals came to my rescue with leadership tips and advice. My collaboration skills blossomed during this period! A major contributor to my organization's success was being open to opinions, ideas, and new alliances. Nothing that we accomplished would have been possible without the support of other people.   	I am thankful for being able to serve as a leader during the pandemic. Though the thought seemed daunting at first, being virtual provided me with a safe transitioning space to grow my presentation and public speaking skills. At the end of the 2020-2021 school year, I was re-elected to serve as the Co-President of MMS once more. But this time, I walked into the position with a new mindset. I was confident, ready, skilled, and prepared.  Looking back, COVID-19 altered the trajectory of my life and so many others in a matter of days. However, it was exactly what I needed to grow as a future leader. Challenges like these are not ones to be taken lightly. As strange as it may sound, I owe the pandemic a bittersweet thank you for forcing me out of my comfort zone.  	 	 	 	 ",Yes

As l was used to a life constantly surrounded by friends and family, the pandemic of COVID-19 created a life in what felt like isolation. Being a person that has a busy mind and is constantly thinking, I was accustomed to being able to get out of my house and surround myself with people, whenever i needed a break from endless thoughts. When the pandemic hit, I was no longer able to go out and hang out with friends, instead I was confined to my own house. This was very difficult for me, because when you have nothing else to do but think, you feel as if you are simultaneously creating and living in a world of illusions. Soon, it began to feel as if I was losing touch with my own reality. I always felt like I needed people to create happiness in my life and escape from any type of stress my mind may have caused me to become overwhelmed with. However, I knew that I needed to learn how to be content with my own company and create my own happiness even when the world around me can be the cause of much dismay. This idea of becoming my own beacon of light, when life begins to be overcome with darkness was paramount to my own success and happiness. Once I began learning how to enjoy new hobbies on my own and taking time to consider the great achievements I have fulfilled in my life, rather than focusing on the bad, I felt at peace with everything going on in my own life and the world around me. I no longer had this void that needed to be filled with the company of others. As the world begins to make its way back to what it once was, I feel that I have come out of this experience with a better understanding of what it truly means to create your own happiness. Sometimes, the world you know of can take a complete change of direction, but I've learned how to adapt to the obstacles life may throw at you, instead of focusing on the things out of my own control.",Yes

For many students like me there were social barriers, learning adjustments, and uncertainty of the future that we all dealt with.  I finished my second semester of freshman year online. I found out about this new change during my spring break which was a shock. The shift completely changed the way I approached school and made it harder to focus. One thing I did to overcome this struggle was to treat the classes like I was still in person. I would get up every morning prepare breakfast for myself, get dressed, and sit at my desk to stay engaged in class. I'd also actively participate with my screen on and actively added to class discussions. I also made sure to rewatch any part of the recorded lectures that I didn't fully understand which benefited me during this time.  I also was not able to physically interact with my friends and be involved on campus because everyone moved back home for lockdown. The lack of in person activities made it hard to sustain friendships with my new college friends especially since I was a freshman. To combat this struggle, I decided to girt involved with organizations at my school that used zoom as a platform to connect students. I met so many new people and was able to develop bonds with them that have lasted. I also made a point to stay connected with my old friends through messaging and calling them frequently.   Lastly, the fear of uncertainty created a distorted reality for me. I was worried about family and friends being okay, that my classes would go well with this transition, and was overwhelmed by so much emotion that built up from uncertainty of the future. When dealing with this I relied mostly on my sister; we went on nature walks, did yoga in the backyard, exercised daily, and were there for each other through this hard time. She was in her last year of high school, so it was hard for her as well not being able to go to prom and senior nights. I also introduced myself to meditation and was able to let out stress and anxiety. I also leaned into my faith in God and knew I couldn't control much so I let overwhelming emotions and thoughts leave my body and mind.   All in all, I was able to find support and comfort in these difficult times by carrying out healthy habits that helped me to overcome the challenges and barriers that were caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

We will not report back to school the next day. Instead, we would have none of the high school experiences worth experiencing like prom, graduation, senior trip, etc., followed by months of online school. I was sitting in my room, melancholy and deep in thought; who knew that this time would be my first encounter with depression? We hear millions of deaths of children in hospitals, and the number of cases rising day by day, all over the news. This pandemic caused depression because I was isolated from friends and family. The world was segregated with rules of social distancing. As someone who loves networking and meeting new people, I found that difficult since it was my first year of college. However, I spoke with my counselor, and I discussed the issues I've been through with depression and having difficulty managing school and social life. Also, being surrounded by immigrant parents who don't understand mental health values has also been burdensome. She recommended me to a therapist in the school. Thankfully speaking with the therapist relieved me from holding all my problems in. I also decided to join clubs such as NABA(National Association Black Accountants). Being a part of NABA made me feel like I wasn't alone. This organization made me find a sense of community, especially since they shared the same physical characteristics. I took little steps to become the Director of Community Affairs because I have always had a passion for helping people in need.

Crazily enough, that is exactly the world we live in today. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I found it challenging not only to adapt to being successful in the virtual environment, but also to become comfortable with interacting with people in-person again.  	Early on, I learned that the virtual work environment can either make or break your brand. In an office setting, you see the same people every day and can easily build relationships with the people you work with. But working in a virtual environment makes it much more difficult to speak to people and, more importantly, build lasting relationships. Because of this challenge, I always made it a point to be memorable and more than simply another face on someone's computer screen. I was forced to take courageous steps in my internships and even with my professors in class in terms of reaching out first and creating a space for my needs to be heard rather than waiting on someone else to do it for me. By expressing my genuine desire to learn and practicing effective communication, I was able to become more comfortable in the virtual space. 	 	However, when in-person events started to come back up, I realized that the extraverted, easygoing version of myself was much harder to come by. After going so long without interacting with large groups or being in close vicinity with others, I found it difficult to come out of my shell and talk to others so easily. I often found myself thinking, ""What would I even say to this person?"" or ""Can they even hear me speaking behind my mask?"" After some time and more interaction with people, I have been able to mostly adjust to face-to-face interaction with others. Though the environment has changed, I have been able to find the joy in interacting with others safely. The pandemic has definitely forced us all to operate differently in various environments, but the biggest lesson I have learned throughout this experience has been to be adaptable to change and be open to learning new ways to create valuable relationships.",Yes

I learn best in a classroom setting where questions can be asked and answered immediately, but online I was forced to teach myself a lot and find answers on my own. I was taking my first accounting class and was doing great before the switch, but when the switch happened it threw me off and my grade started to suffer. I felt like I didn't know what to do but quitting wasn't an option, so I had to figure it out. It was hard, I spent many days with my head in the book trying different things out until I found the answers. Something that helped a lot was realizing that I didn't need to do everything on my own and getting help was an option. I started to get use to emailing teachers with questions, setting up zoom meetings to walk me through certain problems, and really just taking advantage of any resource I could.

Certain effects of the pandemic include things such as people either facing depression, stress, anxiety, or even lack of motivation to name a few. From my own personal perspective, a personal challenge that I have overcome during the Covid-19 pandemic is remaining full of perseverance. Throughout my academic career up until my senior year of high school, I had always been described by my teachers and peers as someone who stayed on top of things as I handled business in a timely manner. When there were things such as projects, assignments, and college applications, I would always do them in a very considerable amount of time before their due dates. However, this changed when the pandemic first started. When high schools across the nation were closed and we were told to remain home, I went from being an active individual with a determined mindset to a lazy individual who showed little to no interest in the things around him. One instance of this is when I had to write my valedictorian speech. Distraught and unmotivated, I procrastinated greatly in writing this speech because I saw as though it had no purpose, especially since my high school did not know at the time whether or not we would have a graduation. Nonetheless, I am proud to say that I have two parents who proceeded to stay hard on me during this time, even up until this day. Without my parents reminding me of the individual that I used to be and my numerous achievements in my academic career, I would have honestly given up because of the negativity I faced because of the pandemic. Because of my parents, on July 16, 2020, I gave my speech with great confidence and purpose as I had returned to my former self but with a new and improved vision. The pandemic had shown me that I needed to be more resilient despite certain circumstances. Even when I started college amongst a pandemic, I did not get discouraged from not having the ideal college experience. Despite social distancing, wearing a mask at all times, attending class either via Zoom or in-person, not being able to attend certain school events, and having to adjust to other changes, I still prevailed. I became involved in different organizations across campus, met new people, attended class regularly and on time, and maintained my grades to a satisfactory level. Today, I am still that same person who is fixated on achieving my goals no matter the obstacles that I am faced with. While the Covid-19 pandemic impacted me negatively at first, it has made me stronger and more determined. No matter the difficulty of a situation, I will never give up because I know that mindset is everything along with perseverance.",

I was forced to move back home for the summer and finish out the semester. I was able to manage when the pandemic first hit. However, last semester I caught COVID. I quarantined for two weeks at the beginning of the semester. This posed a huge threat to my academics because this was my ICORE semester. ICORE is a block unit of courses undergraduate business students take their third year. It consists of marketing, finance, operations, leadership, and team dynamics. The first two weeks are the most critical.  	Those two weeks of quarantine put me at my worst mentally, physically, and financially. I felt very behind in my classes. I lose my sense of taste and I hardly slept. I did not work for almost four weeks which made my pockets take a hit. .After my two weeks of quarantine was over, I still struggled to bounce back. My shortness of breath was still there, and I could not get my rhythm together. I was able to get through the semester with the help of my peers. However, I was not in a great mental space. This semester I made a promise to myself to become better. I created a set schedule. Monday thru Friday I go to the gym in the morning and come home eat, shower, and head to class. I also allocated time to volunteer 4 hours a week at a non-profit organization called My Sister's Closet. Each week, on Saturday, I meal prep and cook my meals for the week to save me time.  	As a result, my mental and physical health has improved tremendously. My coworkers have even noticed a change in my attitude. My grades have improved as well, and I am more engaged. Going through that experience made me take my health a lot more serious.  ",Yes

My world stopped as a Senior in high school because all of my senior incentives were gone before my eyes. I wanted to leave high school with a bang! A bang I left with indeedâ€“ a very rapid and fortuitous bang. The pandemic transitioned people from in-person to online. Thus, my responsibilities didn't stop because a virus was going around. I was still responsible for getting my school work done, being a part of National Honor Society, making sure that the yearbook was complete as Class President, and being an essential worker. A majority of people have said that the pandemic was the worst thing they've experienced in life. As for me, the pandemic saved my life! I was working at McDonald's during the pandemic, since I couldn't stay home due to my adoptive mother releasing her anger out on my sister and I. While working at McDonald's, I learned about saving and budgeting. I never knew how much money could be saved if you don't spend your money. Luckily for me, I only had the choice to save money since I could not go out. By May 1st, which is college decision day, I felt confident enough to be able to go to Morgan State University as an out-of-state student, since I would have enough money for the fall semester at the end of summer. Hence, the pandemic taught me more about financial literacy than any economics or literacy class I took in high school! During the summer time, my household was very detrimental to my mental health. When I heard colleges would not be opening up for the fall semester, my heart sank to the soles of my feet. Fortunately enough, Morgan State University was the answer to my prayers! Morgan State allowed students with extenuating circumstances to dorm on campus with documentary proof. Furthermore, I had the documentation and was able to dorm! I was able to leave New York to go to Maryland for school. At this time, I was now experiencing freedom in every aspect of my life: physically, emotionally, mentally, and financially. Nevertheless, the pandemic led to the loss of many lives but the pandemic was the birth of my life. I've always been in survival mode and never was able to know what living was like. Being at Morgan State now, I am living God willingly! ",

However, thanks to Mrs. Covid-19, it was actually one for the history books! When I arrived on campus from a weekend long friend-cation, silence sang in the halls and BTJs (a wing spot close to campus) was calling my name.   As I made my way down MLK Drive, I admired the surrounding community (per usual) and wondered what stories the potholes held. Suddenly, I felt a buzz come from my pocket so I simultaneously reached for my phone to read the notification on the screen.   Microsoft Outlook - Student Email Yes, it was THAT email- the one informing us that (given the circumstances) we had a week to gather all of our things, part ways with our Panther family, and return home to face uncertainty. Luckily, my family was only 30 minutes south of Atlanta. Still, I ate in silence in awe of the announcement.  Initially, my Transition to a virtual platform was linear. If I am being candid, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to adapt to the change. I quickly proved myself wrong after a virtual Advanced Assurance internship with PricewaterhouseCoopers during Spring 2021 and a remote-learning experience at Clark Atlanta University. During this time, I faced the challenge of exceeding at both my first busy season internship and a remote-learning experience. This experience challenged my grit, time management, and self-discipline. During this time, I actively practiced the art of showing up for myself and others in a digital environment. I made it a mission to begin to work on myself as a woman and a professional to begin to prepare myself for the next chapter of my life. After-all, why not take advantage of this opportunity to slow down, dissect, and reflect? I indulged in reading books, learning new information, and practicing self-care. I continued to do this until it became habitual. This helped reshape my mindset which assisting me with creating opportunities.   I have witnessed the effort, energy, and eagerness that went into building legacy. I have been a part of this panther for going on 4 years now, and I have learned that the legacy keeps building. I would be extremely thankful for this scholarship because it will allow me to fulfill the financial requirements of my desired MAcc program.

Moments after suffering the injury, I realized that this would be a journey and difficult challenge for me to overcome and it would affect me in three important aspects of life: physically, emotionally and mentally. Change is an inevitable part of life and I certainly experienced it through those aspects. I am a student-athlete and within this role, comes great responsibility. Being an athlete involves the potential risk of injuring oneself. I've been in this role for as long as I can remember but when I suffered this injury, that role shifted. My priorities changed and I went through a difficult experience. I felt like I was defeated, and my spirit was broken. There were things I began to experience for the first time ever in life such as depression and anxiety. I would tend to overthink about certain things such as the past, present, and what the future could hold for me. I realized that I could not persevere through this alone and needed support from my family, and resources that would help and encourage me to overcome the adversity I was facing. Some of those resources included receiving mental help through a therapist that was recommended to me by my athletic trainer, and physical therapy with the help of my athletic trainer and family members in which was mostly performed on my own despite the pandemic that was occurring. I struggled and always wondered why this unfortunate event occurred. Then again, I thought maybe this happened for a reason and there is value towards overcoming this. That is when I discovered a new perspective I had on life. I figured out my purpose in life and that is ""to be a successful black influential leader"". I realized I want society to view myself as someone who can balance multiple things in life and still be very successful. I've managed to persevere and recover through a traumatic injury, and to deal with anxiety and depression. Through overcoming these factors, I've also managed to acquire credentials athletically and academically, gained professional experience including two highly competitive internships within a public accounting firm (Grant Thornton), and I've built networking relationships that are essential to developing as a successful black individual (LinkedIn). Personally, I never viewed sports as my identity. It is apart of me and I always used it as a tool to increase my development as a leader, and to take me to certain endeavors such as college. My passion has always been helping others in a selfless act, especially from a financial perspective. Going through this situation allowed me to focus on my career path and what I ultimately would aspire to be - CPA. I have every intention on achieving this goal and want to thank God for putting me in the position to achieve this dream despite the adversity I overcame, as it may be my greatest triumph.",Yes

A phenomenon that had never been seen before that created confusion, fear, and the feeling of not knowing what the future looked like.  This tragedy showed face and disrupted nations all over the world and created new challenges that still need solutions.  The culprit was a virus called Covid-19, and it is the single most disruptive event that has ever happened in the history of our existence.  Community disruptions such as Covid-19 and other natural disasters can have deep lasting impacts. These impacts can be looked at as motivation to do better or could be the foundation of your demise. I chose to use Covid-19 as an opportunity to better my life. Early 2020 when covid hit and people were getting laid off, I found myself sitting on my porch thinking about how my future would be affected by the pandemic.  I was a newly licensed real estate agent and I had just closed on my fifth transaction for the year.  Financially, I was in a good space, but mentally I was lost and exhausted.  I was so focused on succeeding in my new position that I had no time for family or friends.  I realized hard work is only half of the equation to the solution of life.  Growing up, being exceptional in school was never one of my specialties.  It has always been a fear of mine because I had a personal understanding that school was not for me.  For this reason, I always found ways of becoming semi-successful, but deep down I knew having a college degree would put me in a better position. My examples of role models showed great examples of how hard would allow you to live comfortably but not exceptionally.  I realized they were missing high-value skills to afford them better lifestyles and realized I needed change.  That day I decided I would take on the challenge of going back to school and getting a degree in finance.  I chose finance because I realized financial mistakes, I made in my adult life that could've put me in a better position.  I also realized that I had no fundamental knowledge about investing past certificates of deposits (CD accounts) and 401k's, which was usually through my employer.  I applied to Old Dominion University, got accepted and I am now a rising senior with a 3.28 GPA in my core courses.

Reflecting on my time at Michigan State, connecting with passionate, intentional, and sincere people has been the best impact on me, but that isn't without challenges due to Covid-19.   As a sophomore I switched to Broad's College of Business from being a pre-veterinary medicine major. Switching majors was an amazing opportunity that intrusively forced me out of my comfort zone, from wrapping my head around business environments, to speaking up for those that look like me and identify with my experience in the slightest. Attempting to navigate this new environment I wanted to attend as much as I could and meet as many people as possible, unfortunately overwhelmingly those people did not look like me or identify with my sexuality. Yes, I appreciated the experiences they conveyed to me but the interactions didn't permit the questions that filled my mind. Questions like, ""Are you perceived as a competent resource on your teams?"", ""Do you feel empowered to fully express yourself in the work space?"", and ""Through accounting, what spaces provide large strides for Black people?"" I remember these questions vividly, and I was extremely disappointed that my environment couldn't provide the answers or guide me to them being answered.  	 	Iterations of these questions have continued and today I have the resources to get them answered, but I had to build and empower my community to find people that could answer them. Joining NABA and the Broad Student Senate were the first steps to composing my more inclusive vision for Broad Business College. Within NABA I found so many people that look like me with diverse experiences to lift me as they climbed, and empower me to experiences I didn't believe were achievable. This was done with the challenge of virtual connections and events, reaching out to Black professionals for panelists, virtually joining classrooms to advocate for NABA events, and finding any common ground with students to express how there is no limit to their future contributions in any space. Furthermore, the DEI committee within the Broad Student Senate has been a space for advocacy and change. Creating forums for our leaders in the college to answer to their initiatives that fell on a few ears, providing Black professionals and other nationalities for events around the college, and finally being a part of these events and to sit on panels. The challenges of Covid-19 were to communicate in a virtual environment, as we come out of this pandemic I can appreciate the challenge as it helped me grow professionally and ultimately became an opportunity to connect with limitless people within the profession ",Yes

Mentally before Covid, I was coming out of a really bad place, I was finding my way in what already felt like a crazy world and then Covid happened. Being home all day every day with nothing to do was hard, and it was harder going on social media and seeing all of my friends and strangers feeling their best during the pandemic. They were all finding hobbies and new things to do while I was in my room sad all day and didn't even know why I was sad. On top of Covid two months into the pandemic, I lost my uncle to cancer, and right before Covid, I lost a good family friend to cancer as well. I thought the loss of two people back to back didn't affect me but it did and I didn't want to feel any of this. It was hard to get up some days. For me, something I did was look into therapy. As black people therapy is something that is frowned upon and something that many people feel shouldn't happen. I started going to therapy and it felt like such a relief. Being able to spend an hour or more sitting and talking about how I was feeling was so great. I started finding ways to put my mental health first and learning that my mental health matters. Now I currently work to not only keep my mental health good but also try and help others with it as well. At one point I looked at therapy as something that was bad because if you went to therapy it was because you were sick but that isn't the case at all, being able to have someone help me and guide me through ways to approach different situations at hand. Therapy and Mental Health are something that should not only be talked about only in school but with all walks of life no matter the age.

Let's begin with the concept of change. As people develop, we learn that change is a way of life; as we grow and prosper it is something that we as human beings must be ready for. At the beginning of the pandemic, I was working in a medical office, and I was able to keep coming into work in person but everything about the procedures and how our day to day work changed. New screenings, new ways to disinfect, but the most drastic of changes was the uncertainty of patients who possibly could be carrying the virus. People now depended on our office more than ever. I was apart of a loving and supportive team that was not just willing, but excited to give all of our energy and time needed to the patients when they needed our help. At this time people needed our help and needed something to believe in, so we tried our best to create that atmosphere in the office. Our team created new ways to make our environment a safe and encouraging temple for others. From hearing stories of people whose loved ones were dearly departed, to not knowing when or if someone would be laid off or furloughed. I was determined to keep my mental space and mindset in a positive manor, and I made certain to spread this joy anywhere I traveled to. Covid-19 the sickness that uprooted and wreaked havoc on millions of people in this world. Began to force me to realize that I personally could not even begin to discuss the changes that I have experienced without being aware of how the others around me were negatively affected in so many ways. I was fortunate enough to be able to remain employed and mobile during the entire pandemic. As the world continues to experience such life altering changes, I was reminded that we are all here for a reason. I found my purpose again and was more dedicated than ever to complete school. From this pandemic I was reminded that our community and culture needs someone like me more now than ever. With businesses closing and unemployment at an all-time high, it is more prevalent now than ever that our community needs to be uplifted. I do not want to just simply become an accountant! I am striving to accomplish this for my fellow African American community and the future that will be impacted by this. Covid has shined a bright light on the wealth gap and lifestyle inequalities that we as a people are facing. Because of this tragedy it truly has removed the blinders from my eyes.

Before the pandemic I had two jobs and was a full-time accounting major at Baruch. Time management and energy allocation has been highlighted as one of my skills, which has enabled me to take responsibility of Baruch's community affairs as of 2021. The shutdown and pandemic provided a moment, to think, process, and reflect.  	I now find myself enrolled back into school, but this time unemployed and no source of income. Constantly faced with the choices of professional development workshops versus working a shift to cover my bills, left me at a deficit.

Yes, I can manage it, but at what cost? My mental health is the cost.  The pandemic wasn't the only traumatizing event we have had to endure. Blacks Lives Matter movement had a long-lasting effect on me. The movement acknowledged the social barriers and hardships people of color must face at the hands of America, its institution's ideologies, and how they show through the cracks. Cultural assimilation is mistaken for cultural diversity and inclusion. I was exposed to the reality of execution versus presentation.  Every day I now challenge the reality of Eurocentric ideologies of business and this socialization of class and race, that may be colorblind in corporate America. I transformed from Accounting CPA track to CUNY BA program, because my reality wasn't inclusive just finance. As a CUNY BA student I voyage on a journey not only to challenge the norm, but to redefine and create a new way of viewing economics and its influence on the world.

COVID-19 began during my freshman year of college. The first year of college for students can already be challenging due to the uncertainty one faces when entering a new environment. Additionally, the first year can be stressful as one is faced with the challenges of living away from home for the first time, making new friends, and adjusting to the college academic environment after coming from high school. While facing those challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic began and started another slew of challenges. After completing in person schooling during the majority of my life, shifting to online classes proved to be more challenging than I had anticipated.   One of the most important lessons I learned while learning to overcome this challenge is to not be afraid to ask for help. Being willing to ask questions and schedule zoom meetings with my professors became one of the most helpful ways for me to adapt to the online learning environment. Additionally, online learning was a new experience for many students when the COVID-19 pandemic began. As a result, learning online also taught me how to be adaptable.   The accounting field can be quick paced, and accountants can be expected to meet quick turnarounds or deadlines at times. Knowing how to be adaptable will help me to be able to pivot and be the best that I can be in any environment. Though the barriers faced throughout the COVID-19 pandemic were challenging, I believe that I have come out of this experience as a better version of myself. The barriers of COVID-19, such as online learning, challenged me to grow and self-reflect.   Learning how to be adaptable and learning the importance of asking for help were both valuable learning experiences for me and are lessons that I will continue to carry beyond college. As an entry level employee in the workplace, there will be topics that I learned about in school and there will also be many topics that I am encountering for the first time. Being willing to ask questions and not being afraid to ask for help will allow me to put my best foot forward when completing my responsibilities. Moving forward, I believe that learning how to overcome the challenges I faced during COVID-19 will help me to be the best that I can be as I enter the workforce.",Yes

When building my first connection at my golf caddy job or leaving home to go to Alabama to play golf, change seemed glorious. However, my viewpoint of change would not stay the same. The Covid-19 pandemic caused unexpected changes to occur in my life that I have had to adjust to and am still adjusting to this day. These changes involved loss, anxiety, and love.  In almost every culture in the world, the matriarch plays a vital role in keeping the family together. Judith Johnson was the glue that held mine together. I still remember walking the dogs with her and just catching up, her tight hugs, and the thoughtfulness she displayed every time I visited. A month into the shutdown, my grandma passed away. She didn't die from COVID, but because of COVID, we couldn't be with her during her final moments. The state of the world at the time of her passing made my mourning even more unbearable. Everywhere you would look from television to social media you would see stories of people's loved ones dying alone. I wanted to cry, scream or hit something at least to express my emotions, but I felt like I couldn't. As a Black man, it's often frowned upon and seen as weak to do these things. To accept her passing, I journaled and even cried a little bit. Besides losing my grandma, I struggled to adjust as a college athlete. I was a golf player at Alabama A&M University for two years when COVID struck. My routine was thrown off. Instead of practicing, training, and traveling the circuit to compete in tournaments,  I was back at home. Feelings of panic and dread at the slightest thought about what the future held in store for the game that I fell in love with filled my head. The longer I went with uncertainty, the more I began to question my love for golf. When it was confirmed that we could go back to school things didn't get any easier. Waking up at 5 am to train and doing homework after a long day of school and practice didn't feel the same. My passion for the game had changed and I also went into a spiral of self-doubt regarding my skill. I took the lesson of pushing through moments of change that I learned from my grandma's passing and applied them to golf. In addition to mandated practices, I attended extra training. This resulted in better skills, confidence, and a newfound understanding of my passion for the game. As mentioned before, change is inevitable but my viewpoint of it has done just that. My life has changed drastically through loss, uncertainty, and love from the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite that, I am accepting change one day at a time. ",Yes

With that being said, it is hard to choose just one major thing that was affected. A challenge I have faced is the fear of being stuck at school. With the pandemic going strong and numbers consistently rising, being in college with careless young people because very nerve-racking.  People do not find it important to wear a mask and because of that, I felt I was truly putting myself in danger every day just by going to class. With that being said when it came to Thanksgiving and Christmas break, I was terrified to go home because I did not want to bring the disease to my dad who has M.S., and my mother who is older as well. I was able to overcome that situation by just doing what I was supposed to do by maintaining social distance, wearing a mask, and even getting tested before I went home. Doing all these things brought me some form of peace, so that way I was able to spend time with my support system and regroup before I came back to college. A barrier I have faced is the adjustment of learning during the paramedic. I think the way I have had to attend school these past two years has changed three times. It went from all online and listening to our teacher either virtually or them just giving us notes and just giving us assignments, to then hybrid, where you only go in sometimes, and then to completely in person. All these switch-ups have made learning very hard and having to make a new adjustment almost every semester caused me to struggle a lot at the beginning of the semester. Despite the struggle at the beginning, by reaching out to my professor and studying longer than I normally would, I was able to get past this barrier. I ended up doing well in my classes during the past two years while the pandemic was going on. Though I faced these problems, I handled them the best way I knew how with the resources I had access to. In doing that I overcame all I was faced with and I am grateful that my family is healthy and whole and that I am continuing to have a successful college career.   ",Yes

The pandemic made it so that people had to social distance, stay inside, and just all around be away from people but the people you live with. That was a challenge for me because I was a social person during that time. On Fridays I would always go to basketball games, Saturdays I would go to the mall as well as do things throughout the week. All of that came to a complete halt during the pandemic. I couldn't go outside anymore, I couldn't see my friends. When the pandemic first started, and everybody had to stay home for 2 weeks in my state I was with my mom. I could not even go home to see my dad, brother, and my dog. Another thing was closing school so I wouldn't be able to play football and work out to better myself for the next football season. All of this was really unexpected and threw my whole schedule off. Eventually, when I was with my dad I didn't really go and see my mom much, so it was hard thing to deal with. I was sad most of the time and didn't really want to be in the house or do much of anything. I was in the bed all day just on my phone, watching tv, or sleeping. It was depressing because I couldn't do the activities I used to be able to do. I was becoming lazier, and I didn't like it. Being in the bed wasn't my character, I was a social person. To try and help that I talked to my mom every day, even if it was only to say hi and how was she doing. I also talked to my friends every day and played video games until late night just to connect with them more. For football I used to work out in my room every night for an hour just doing push-ups and other body workouts to help better myself. Eventually slowly the restrictions looser and I was able to see my friends and family outside so during those times I would be happy. I got to play football with my team, see my friends more, as well as see my mom more so it was good. I think that doing those things really helped keep me mentally intact as a person. Knowing my type of character not being social and being with the people I love takes a toll on me so doing those things helped me get through the pandemic.",

Nobody knew at the time, but this was the start of a global pandemic that would change the world forever. By May, 2020, most of the world was locked inside their homes the world economy was shut down. Millions of lives were lost due to COVID-19, and even more were altered. For me, COVID stopped me from going to my dream college. But I continued to hard work and I was able to put myself in a better position than I ever dreamed of being in.  In the weeks before the U.S. shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I got accepted by my dream school, The University of Houston. I worked hard enough in high school to get in and I was ecstatic about the prospect of going to the college I always wanted to attend. But, when the pandemic shut the world down, everything changed. Me and both my parents weren't able to work for months and, without much income, the prospect of going to UH looked more and more unlikely. In July, my parents told me that I wasn't going to be able to attend UH because of our financial situation. At first I was devastated, I had worked hard to get into UH and for me to not be able to attend my dream school was hard to accept. But I didn't give up, and I quickly started to look for another way to attend UH. That alternative was Austin Community College.  	In August of 2020, I applied and was accepted into Austin Community College. My goal was to do well at ACC and hope that, in two years, I would be able to transfer into UH. By then, my family's financial situation might be better and I would only have to pay for two years of University. While at ACC I worked as hard as possible to get the best grades possible. While most people were struggling with online school, I was getting the best grades of my life. After two semesters at ACC I got a 3.88 GPA, which was more than enough to be able to get into UH. While my GPA was still high, I decided to apply to other colleges and see if I could get into a bigger school. In June, 2021, I was accepted into the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. When I got the acceptance letter I was overcome with emotion. Just a year prior I was crying that I couldn't attend my dream school because of the pandemic, and now I got accepted into one of the best business schools in the country. 	This experience taught me that when bad things happen they can actually be blessings in disguise. It is up to you to overcome your trials and to put yourself in a better position than before.",

It affected millions of people and became the equivalent modern-day Spanish flu of 1910s. By mid-February 2022, the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the U.S. is estimated to be around 437 million. These statistics are truly alarming and brings high concerns and problems for billions of people around the globe and course of action need to be taken seriously. The challenges that I overcame during the pandemic are remote learning, weight gain, and the lack of communication.  	         Virtual Learning was most definitely challenging to me at first because everything was new, and very unorthodox, especially in traditional institutions. The approach I utilized to combat is reading the chapters and answering questions in the back of the sections, thus I can apply the concepts and skills to reinforce the knowledge for the course. Second, look for external resources like online practice questions and tutorials. Third, meeting with my teachers after acquiring new information to ask my professors more insightful questions for greater understanding and wholesome explanations.  	 	My diet at the start of the pandemic was good, but the quarantine made it awful. The only thing I could do during that time was go to the fridge and a benign watch Netflix because everything is close, especially the health center. Healthy eating and working-out is part of my lifestyle in which keeps me balanced. The way I overcame this situation was buying a scale to keep track of my weight and purchasing a gym membership with the goal of shredding forty-five pounds. CrossFit is amazing and very enjoyable, which yield to my success in controlling my weight while being body positive and controlling my diet.  	       Communication is an important skill to be effective and must be perfected to get results you need. This is something I most definitely learn is pivotal in your overall progression socially and professionally. Communication is not only verbal, but it is how you do everything. During the start of the pandemic, I did not know how to communicate most effectively through our virtual settings that which was detrimental to me in many ways. With time, I learned what I needed to do get to where I wanted to be and to start establishing a network so I can be effective in my endeavors.  	        Since March 2020, the world has been forever changed and evolved into something that no one has experience. We are probably some of the first humans to ever experience a dynamic shift in life in how we conduct our everyday affairs. Mankind has learned to cope with what is and not what was. Some things are planned and predestined; others truly miraculous in its completeness. One thing that stands valid in my scenario is that remote learning, weight gain, and lack of communication during the pandemic could not be ignored. ",Yes

My life had flipped upside down when my mom broke her leg in two places. Once my mom returned home, I stepped up various responsibilities that I had never taken on before. My mom could not work, so I had to take extra shifts as a cashier at a grocery store to cover expenses such as groceries, car payments, and gas. During these extra shifts, I took 18 credits (which is considered a whole load of classes at my university) virtually while balancing online-only extra-curricular activities such as my sorority, NABA, and Beta Alpha Psi. On top of school and work, I had to become a part-time caretaker for several months because my mother was forced to be bedridden due to her injuries. This was one of the most stressful experiences of my life. Most of the hours in my day-to-day life were dedicated to school, work, or my mother. My mother could not be seen by doctors regularly due to the high Covid cases increasing wait-times by hours, causing her to suffer more pain at home. My grades began to drop because I had difficulty adapting to the virtual classroom setting, we were forced into by the pandemic. My medical anxiety ran high at work due to the high exposure of people I experienced as a cashier during the high increases of Covid cases. My self-care during this time was horrible, and I was not managing my stress correctly. Life became very bleak to me during the five months I experienced this. I almost lost all hope in my future; the keyword is almost. I knew that I had big dreams for my future and that my circumstances did not determine my future, so I decided that I wanted to take back the power of my life back. I began therapy to maintain my stress and build better time management skills. I budgeted my money, so I could both contribute to expenses and grow my personal net worth through savings and investment tools. I communicated with my teachers about my home life situation and collaborated on academic success plans, causing me to maintain my 4.0 GPA. I still was able to be active in my virtual campus community through events and social media. I motivated my mom to regain the ability to complete regular activities such as walking to the kitchen and standing up to rebuild her independence.  My mom's hospitalization was one of the most challenging experiences I had to face in life, and the Covid-19 pandemic only amplified its intensity.  I may have to take breaks from the challenges of my situation, but I never gave up. This challenge only grew me as a person; it allowed me to become more independent, more assertive, and grew self-confidence.

Like everyone else, I was stunned by the sudden onset of a global pandemic. The impact of Covid-19 in Trinidad and Tobago, where I am from, was pretty severe. Like the rest of the world, we went into lockdown in an attempt to mitigate the spreading of the virus. Watching the number of deaths and cases rise was quite surreal and made me fear for myself and my loved ones. In addition to this, I felt concerned about the uncertainty of the future that came with the pandemic.  In my case, I planned to study in the US, as I believed the level of education and opportunities would be greater than in my home country. However, the uncertainties presented by the pandemic left me unsure whether I would still be able to pursue this goal. As such, I decided that I would take a gap year, with plans of using that time to further explore my career and educational interests while waiting for the health and travel restrictions related to the pandemic to improve. As a result of the fluctuating severity of Covid in Trinidad, finding employment or avenues to remain productive was difficult. As I often compared myself to my peers, who had chosen to start university online, I was conflicted about whether I had made the right decision. The uncertainty of my future left me in a rut and I felt as though I was stagnating with my future and would be left behind. Since I felt so unsure about my plan, I kept it from a lot of people because I worried about judgment or that they would ask follow-up questions, which would only exacerbate my already conflicted state. I was in this mental state for three months into my gap year before I gradually came to terms with the situation of not being able to move forward with my plans for a while.  Eventually, when I could see a little light at the end of the tunnel in terms of countries reopening their borders and vaccinations being developed, I started to get out of this state. Further reminding myself of the benefits of studying in the US also helped with this. I could get out of my comfort zone and explore different options, which would facilitate self-improvement. In retrospect, I think that taking the gap year enabled me to mature quite a bit, which I think is important, especially when going to a foreign country to study. Ultimately, through a lot of self-reflection, I thought that I came out of the pandemic mentally stronger than I was before it.   ",Yes

I graduated in December of 2019 after my first master's at the University of St. Thomas where I acquired an MBA in finance. The pandemic started in March of 2020 which made it quite impossible to get a job, and that's how I discovered my first passion for photography, Photography for me I would say is a talent I never knew existed, I always took pictures of friends and family randomly but I never thought I would take it seriously, they always complimented and complained at the same time that when I take their picture it looks better than when they take it themselves. I thought probably they were joking until one day a friend asked if I could use his camera to take pictures at his birthday, and I must say for someone who had never used a DSLR camera before the pictures came out as if it was a professional. Even though I was sad about not having a job after graduation I turned to the ever-so-knowing YouTube for resources on how to take photography more seriously. It is a lot as you must understand lighting and how to use it to one's advantage.   In the middle of the year 2020 there I was opportune to attend the NABA conference and I had a conversation with a representative from Deloitte who encouraged me to think outside the box and see each challenge as an opportunity, he also sparked up an interesting conversation which involved Amazons Web Service and what I thought about it. At the moment I had no much knowledge about it. But, after doing a little research I was really drawn towards so much that my curiosity led me to pursue an MSc in Information Systems degree from Texas Southern University where I have been faced with lots of challenges like coding and learning data structures and analytical tools that can be used to forecast and make better decisions withing an organization as I had a totally different background. The decision was driven by my passion to create a successful international business. My short-term goal is to work as a Project Manager or Financial Analyst where I will gain ample work experience in business operations. Long-term, I envision myself as a successful global business owner who has the skills and knowledge needed to build a successful company by making better decisions that yield high productivity and efficiency. I am thrilled for the opportunity to apply to this prestigious scholarship. As a first-generation master's student, I have had to create a path of success for myself. Having financial support would mean so much in completing my education with less stressors. It is an honor to be considered as a candidate which will help me achieve my career goals. ",

During Covid, my mom had a huge surgery with which she would be bedridden for at least four weeks. Because of Covid, nursing assistants couldn't come to our house, and she couldn't stay in a hospital to recover and get the care she needed due to strict guidelines as well as the risk of her contracting Covid. So, during that period, I had to care for her by making sure she ate, was able to get in and out of bed, perform sanitation treatments and so on. I was lucky to have two siblings to share the care with, but despite that, my work as well as theirs added a great challenge. I had never had professional work experience, so working my full-time job, a PayPal internship that I had gotten through NABA, as well as a part-time job at my county's local government for a combined total 50+ hours a week led to a huge development in my time management skills, question-asking skills, and just overall grit. Being mostly virtual in my jobs meant that there was a lot of time that I was doing work by myself, so to make the most of the little face to face time I had with managers, I had to learn how to ask good questions and follow-ups, as well as how to take effective notes. This helped me because in the time that I wasn't on a zoom with them, I would be able to work most effectively and have time to take care of my mom. Also, learning how to effectively research helped me because if I was not able to anticipate all the questions I might have while I had my managers on the line, or if it were just a concept that I could learn off the internet, then research off the clock was the way to go because I could do that at my own pace while managing my other responsibilities. Last and probably the most important thing that helped me overcome this difficult yet rewarding time was just being motivated to succeed. Being given the opportunity to intern at a Fortune 500 as a freshman thanks to NABA made failure not an option. However, my mom's health and wellbeing suffering because of that was not an option either. So just having the mindset that anything less than success wasn't an option really carried me through this time, especially when I couldn't get as much support as I usually would have due to Covid. My mom always tells me ""If there's a will then there's a way,"" so having that will allowed me to not just succeed and receive a return offer from both PayPal and the government job, but also helped me enable my mom to make a full recovery from her surgery.",Yes

While being on a college campus, it was difficult to adjust because we transitioned to online format suddenly. For some students the online format was a beneficial change because they worked better through an asynchronous format. But, for many other organizations and people, the lack of personal interaction caused problems.  The lack of personal interaction had a real impact on Ohio State's National Association of Black Accountants. As a member my freshman year, NABA was the most interactive group where black students felt welcomed to discuss topics with recruiters. But, once Covid-19 hit it was difficult to keep students active and consistent. Furthermore, going into my sophomore year NABA was on the verge of crumbling on OSU's campus. There was a lack of commitment from E-Board members with exhaustion of meeting online. Students weren't committed to attending meetings because they did not care for the virtual atmosphere or missed the weekly meals we had at our meeting. So, once the succession of a new E-Board was due I was basically handed the President position, because I was one of the only people who were consistently active. This lack of consistency did not stop me from making a progressive change though. I knew that NABA had a great impact on me my 1st-year, so I wanted to recreate that positive atmosphere that I was accustomed to for the rest of my 2nd-3rd year. This resulted in me having to organize a new E-Board that was dedicated and also create an environment where students wanted to be active. OSU's NABA still had companies coming in every week to talk about the opportunities they provided, but students were not interested in making a commitment to meetings online. So, I had to establish incentives like different gifts and promotions that encouraged people to attend. NABA has developed a culture where black people in business are able to thrive. Covid-19 has made it hard for people to create relationships, but this did not stop me from working to re-establish that culture. With dedication I have been able to get new student members active and currently we are working on our environment of growth. Covid-19 isn't over, but this has not stopped us from making a change for the better.  ",Yes

The pandemic not only sent my family into a frenzy of health concerns, but it has definitely made me isolated to the point to where I entered a period of my life where I had to ""come of age"". I recently learned that I am not alone in this, and that the isolation has opened up a lot of wounds from trauma that occurred earlier in life for many people. I can say I am one of those people. I am 22 years old. Most people go through periods in their life where they have mental breakdowns and realize they need to start their process of healing and going to therapy. This is what the pandemic has forced me to do. This started a few months into the onset of the pandemic, and it automatically caused me to want to put school on the backburner and take care of my mental health so that I can heal and move forward in my life to further pursue academic successes. As studious as I am, I did not feel that I had the liberty to let my grades slip, so I still did the best I could in school while dealing with the mental health issues from the isolation. The loneliness that the pandemic first brought along with it played a major part in forcing me to realize that I have a struggle with mental health. This negatively affected my Spring 2021 grades the most, as I tried my best to push through being closed off from everybody and trying to heal from my depression. Regardless of the repercussions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, I can say that I am grateful for the experience. I realized that mental health is of utmost importance; if I kept having to push through life blissfully unaware that I needed help, I do not know where I would be later in life when I am already having to work a full-time job.",Yes

The start of the pandemic occurred during  my senior year of high school. What was supposed to be my best and last year of high school turned into my worst nightmare. At first we were told that school would only be closed for 2 weeks. Those 2 weeks, however, turned into a month, then bled into the end of the school year and even through summer. I missed basketball games, prom, and even graduation. I had to sit at home, secluded from the outside world. Although it was a financial burden for my parents, I was blessed to have had the opportunity to still be able to attend my first year of college.  I say a financial burden, because my parents paid for me to sit in my dorm room, alone, and attend classes virtually when I could have been home doing the same thing. I am grateful that my parents made the sacrifice and allowed me to stay on campus. I was one of the lucky ones.  At the last minute, my roommate's parents decided not to pay for on-campus housing and my roommate was not allowed to attend school on campus for the first year. This left me with my own dorm room.  At first, it was nice having the extra space, but I began to feel alone and I really felt like I was missing out on my college freshman year. Not only did I spend the year alone in my dorm, I didn't get the chance to experience true campus life. Social events were limited because of COVID policies which made it harder to make new friends. I felt depressed at one point and even considered staying home for the spring semester. My grades suffered. My parents encouraged me to keep pushing myself. I continued to study hard in a non-traditional setting and tried to find ways to make friends and have fun despite the restrictions. My first COVID year of college really matured me. Not only did I have the opportunity to live on my own, but had to deal with a lifestyle that came with the pandemic. I am now in my sophomore year of college with most of these restrictions now gone. I live off campus, have met new friends and even joined a fraternity. Having lived through COVID times has taught me skills that I wouldn't have learned otherwise. I was always a very good student in high school.  Seeing my GPA drop my freshman year was a rude awakening for me. I learned how to stay productive and manage my class schedules.

During my first year in college, we were fully virtual, which made it both easier and harder to meet given circumstances. It was a lot easier to meet since everyone just hopped on zoom calls, but because many people weren't motivated to do work remotely and had work among other things going on in their lives it always seemed like people were missing at events and meetings. Not to mention that fact that people could just not show up and you would have no way to prove if they were busy or just intentionally missing out. It has gotten slightly better during my second year as my school has moved to a more hybrid space, but it has caused me to realize people aren't making time for in person meetings in many cases that also has posed a challenge.  The main way I have solved this was to divide tasks into much smaller groups (most of my teams were with 7+ people) so that even if people weren't pulling their part, we would still get the work done. It also helped to provide documents containing the information we had discovered along the way so that the team would be prepared in case people didn't show up to the presentation day. While I haven't liked living in the pandemic much, I feel like it has given me more self-reliance than I had before, As I haven't had as much help adjusting to things as I had in the past.

Necessity forced invention upon some, while others learned new skills and underwent major life changes. The COVID-19 pandemic affected me personally in more ways than one. I was an international student over 3000 miles from home, who was suddenly awoken one morning to an email from my school's administration, informing all students that the campus was to be vacated by the end of a two-week period. Two days after receiving that horrifying email, my home country, Dominica, closed its borders. Not only was I being forced out of school, but I could not even have gone home, despite being financially unable to do so. I was immediately thrown into a panic due to current immigration policies disallowing me to remain in the United States if not enrolled in school. Thankfully, the policies made allowances for the pandemic, but I was still faced with the challenge of finding a place to live. After many phone calls I was finally able to settle with estranged family in Texas. I was able to settle in their home, but I still had to bear the burden of online schooling. I believed that I lacked the willpower to seriously commit to attending classes online and completing assignments in a timely manner. I believed that I would have been easily distracted and procrastination would get the better of me â€“ and I was right. When my school switched to online learning, I had a hard time adjusting. Eventually I was able to regain control of the situation and continue to excel academically. Ironically, I would not define near homelessness, bankruptcy, or even online schooling as challenges that I experienced from the pandemic. My greatest challenge was a culmination of all these things â€“ escaping my own mind. I had to overcome fear, anxiety, impatience, and self-doubt; as an extrovert it was no easy task. My personality feeds off others' energy and being constrained within a house was heart-wrenching. When summer began, I was thrown deep into depression; I was too afraid to travel or even go outside because the news had me terrified. It wasn't until I decided to turn off the television and seek avenues to dissipate my energy that I began to feel better. I began exercising, trying new hobbies, and even dieting to engage my brain. While I was fortunate enough free myself from my own mental prison many others remain trapped. We are nearing the end of the pandemic tunnel, and I hope that when we get through to the other side everyone can find the help that they need to recover. Lives were altered and many were lost. Some were shielded from receiving the brunt of the illness while others were fortunate enough to never contract it â€“ but I don't think anyone was truly spared.

Due to African American history with exploitation in medicine (such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study), I received my first shot of the Pfizer vaccine at Roseland Community Hospital from a black nurse who was not vaccinated herself. My grandfather and great-grandmother passed away from COVID-19 and, although unrelated, my alma mater highschool's enrollment dropped over 40% due to the mass technical and political disorganization COVID19 amplified in black households. This systemic lack of economic resources is fed from historical debts and in acknowledging these debts, all blacks households also experience an inherent layer of social demoralization day by day.   The disruptions black communities faced during the pandemic initially took a strong toll on my motivation and plan forward as a young adult. During the season of George Floyd riots, I spent most of my time focusing in on my first year at RSM US LLP. I wondered whether I should have also been in attendance, but I felt it was best I stay professionally focused as I am 1 of 2 black people in my line of business. I also reconcile my lack of attendance in the truth that I make my own unique impact as a black man by simply being able to open future doors in the accounting field. Plus, RSM US LLP provides me other flexibilities to make an impact. For example, although I work full-time, I also operate a sewing program at my alma mater highschool for students called ""Sew What?."" But even still, during the 2020 summer, one of my black male students were shot.   Although I am offering a sewing program, working full-time in accounting, and studying for the CPA, I must always overcome wondering whether or not what I am doing is enough. The truth that this discourse is the constant struggle of the African American; the struggle of those historically left-out. The pandemic has simply shifted a light on the truth that we always will face challenges or barriers that make life, as we desire it, out of reach. Nobody can deny that all must face challenges and figure a way to navigate and settle with a new reality. The January 6th insurrection is a symbol of the bubbling up of this realization. Settling with ""what it is"" is sometimes easier to swallow than not. What I do to overcome is remember that the future can be used to reshape society in the that way I think it cold be. This concept is exciting to me. It makes me thirsty to continue being frank with the present in an effort of organizing my master plan for future. I hope to inspire all students with this same drive that, regardless of our current circumstance, time allows us to strategize a major shift forward. If bat a can fart on a scientist and make masks essential globally(COVID-19), we surely can also strategize an effect that changes our society forever.  ",

The economy was disrupted, lives were lost, and we all experienced social isolation to a new extent. Personally, a major challenge I faced during the pandemic was my declining mental health, more specifically, my generalized anxiety and depression disorder. While, in the past, I occasionally battled with anxiety, during the pandemic, my anxiety was exacerbated. Not only did seeing the number of lives lost on CNN deteriorate my mental health, but my parents both lost their jobs. I woke up every morning feeling depleted, and the room felt like it was spinning at all times. I felt so helpless and as if my life had no purpose. The activities such as attending NABA meetings or reading novels no longer brought me joy. Losing physical contact with family and friends furthered this agonizing feeling. This isolation only left me alone with my self-defeating thoughts.  I knew that I was in deep need of repairing and prioritizing my mental health. I had to sit with myself and revaluate the negative thought processes that became habitual. Even though the pandemic limited how much help I could attain with my disorders, I, at the time, learned to utilize all of my resources. I began doing research from accredited scientific journals on what I could do to alleviate my anxiety and depressive symptoms. I learned more about endorphins and the dopamine cycle. I found it in my best interest to go on hour walks in the morning and utilize the serotonin that the sun provided me. Most importantly, I knew that therapy would be of great service to me. The roadblock in the way was that my family was barely making ends meet, asking for therapy felt like too great of a burden.  I searched everywhere for free or affordable therapy sessions. I visited my city's site for COVID relief resources. Upon looking, I found a free counseling treatment for six months. I was able to unpack so much trauma and develop healthy coping mechanisms to midgait my anxiety and depression. After multiple months, I noticed a significant improvement in my anxiety and depressive symptoms. I made substantial progress in my day to day life. I woke up with optimism and had the energy to be able to get through that semester. I found joy in myself that I thought I had lost before. I was able to push through and earn a 3.87 GPA that semesterâ€”which felt unattainable for that period of my life.  Although these last couple of years have been difficult for me, I learned how important it is to be proactive, regardless of how daunting my circumstances may feel. The world is full of opportunities to help those in difficult situations; we must reach out to attain that help. I can now say that I have not experienced a depressive or anxious episode since that period early in the pandemic. ",Yes

I just applied to Towson University for Fall 2020, even though, I was not sure to go to college because of lack of money. Moreover, for the entirety of my ""rest year"" I had nothing productive to do because of some family issues. I used to spend my days walking outside to speed up time. When the pandemic hit, I was scared to keep walking. So, I stayed indoors glued to my phone and bed. After a month, I felt I could not keep being idle because it would lead to depression, therefore, I had to find new hobbies to keep me going. I started working out, reading, and meditating. I worked out six days a week and progressively loved my new self. My physical health made me gain confidence and gave me the stamina to keep pushing forward. Although I hated reading before the pandemic, I gave in due to boredom and read a book twice about teenage mental health that was lying around in my room. What a lifesaver that book. Finally, I spent some quiet time acknowledging the world around me and being thankful even in this time of global grief. After creating this vigorous routine of optimism, I received an acceptance letter from Towson University. It felt like a dream come true. In all anxiety, I started college, and only three weeks in I quickly realized that online learning was not for me. Although I have always been a straight A's student, keeping focused and managing my time became more than challenging. It was a tough semester so much so I ended every week in tears. Given everything, I decided not to give up and keep my eyes on the prize. I began planning more, eliminating distractions, and asking more questions. Ever since, I treated school as a full-time job, where the hours of work were fully dedicated to learning, doing work ahead, and understanding the materials. I slightly realized that my grades got better, and my GPA kept increasing despite my heavy course load during the regular semesters and summer classes. Today, I have made up for my ""lost""/gap year and I am a junior whilst in my second year at Towson with a GPA of 3.7/4 overall. In conclusion, these challenges helped me push myself beyond my limits. Although the Covid-19 virus has saddened our world, little steps to betterness during these times did indeed change lives. I managed to turn my boredom into a mental and physical wellness journey by finding ways to make myself happier indoors.

There have been changes and challenges to multiple sectors which include workplaces, school systems, and businesses amongst others.   One of the challenges I faced amidst the pandemic was starting off this fall semester by contracting the coronavirus. I am currently the senior resident assistant at my university and as part of my duties, I am required to check students into the residence halls at the start of the semester. Now of course, there are standard procedures in place for us to follow when checking students in, however, unfortunately, there were students who still tried to check in although they tested positive. The rules were clear that students could not check in without a negative covid test amongst other requirements. It was disheartening that a select few students still tried to disregard the health and safety of others and came anyways. Some only tested when they came to campus, and it was mostly irresponsibility on their end. As a result of this, I contracted it and had to remain quarantined for almost 2 weeks until I was cleared. Throughout that time, I decided that I would not let this virus get the best of me and I pushed through by doing some of my work tasks virtually, constantly keeping up to date with my professors about classes and notified them of my health status and completed whatever schoolwork or readings I could. This was a serious matter, and my intentions are never to put others at risk. There were a few delays in classes however, I have very understanding lecturers and they helped me along this process.  I think resiliency is a key factor in my life, because having survived a category five hurricane back in my home country Dominica in 2017, it prepared me for the worst of situations and I knew that regardless of what happened, I would pull through.   Furthermore, the pandemic started during my first year of university in a new country, the U.S. As an international student, the process of attaining sponsorships and internships posed more challenges to my career process and it was difficult to navigate my way through at first. Even with the pandemic starting within my first year, I was still able to secure a virtual internship with Deloitte and worked my way through towards now securing a full time offer upon my graduation within the field of audit. I think that we all faced limitations and challenges throughout the course of this pandemic in one way or another, and with the right encouragement, zeal and people in our lives, we can do a lot more than what we limit ourselves to.

In-person learning was necessary for me to focus on lectures and create connections with professors and classmates. Here is where most of my learning happened, as there were few distractions, and learning was my only priority for those 90 minutes. I thrived in classroom settings and found my love for learning and studying in this controlled environment.  However, March 12, 2021, was my last ""normal"" college day. The rapid spread of Covid-19 forced all schools to move to remote learning and all students to adjust to this new normal. The transition from in-person learning to online classes was a big challenge for me as I found it hard to focus in a space that was once mainly used for my leisure. It was difficult for me to communicate my thoughts with my professor and build relationships with my classmates through a screen. I felt disconnected from everyone and even discouraged from attending classes.   I soon realized that I was not alone through connecting with friends, influencers, and other college students on social media. Knowing that I was not the only individual feeling these odd effects of online school made me feel seen and heard. It motivated me to push harder to adapt because I now understood that life kept going even though we were all isolated.   Overcoming the barriers of online learning was difficult. I intentionally found creative ways to become motivated and work effectively. Remembering my goal of attaining an accounting degree was only the start of my motivation. I ensured that I would always take my classes at my desk, participate in class discussions, and attend my professor's online office hours when I needed clarity on particular topics. I made it my mission to be better than yesterday and a little more knowledgeable than I was in the class before.  Through the help of TikTok and YouTube productivity influencers like ""Creating with Lucy"" and ""Janice Studies,"" I was able to find my own pace and study style in this new environment. The pandemic forced me to become more disciplined, focused, and determined to achieve academic and personal excellence. I learned through this experience to become more adaptive in the way I learn, communicate, and participate in discussions. This global pandemic also equipped me with the skills to maintain a healthy work-life balance.   Covid-19 was devastating to encounter, but the pandemic allowed me the opportunity to grow and flourish, which many prior generations never had.

From an unemployment crisis to travel restrictions, the public has not been free of Covid-19's tyranny since its inception. The Pandemic has made a long-lasting impact on the world today and will continue to impact the world many years from now. When the world was introduced to the virus in 2020 I had no idea it would impact me to the extent that it did. February 2020 I was a tutor for my school's academic success department. Social distancing mandates required that I start taking appointments virtually. Virtual appointments meant that students had to request me, as I originally was walk-in only tutor. Meaning my new appointments were on a need basis, resulting in a decreased number of hours and eventually me applying for unemployment. My mother did not like the sound of me being on unemployed assistance so she forced me to look for a job in my hometown, Johns Creek, GA. This ruined my summer plans because while I was in an active application/interview process for summer accounting internships I was forced to put a halt on my plans and work at 5 â€“ Guys. The 5 â€“ Guys hired me and I worked for 3 weeks before the manager explained that the store would be letting go of a few associates due to a decrease in customer traffic. This time unemployment assistance was needed. I had already missed my window to land an internship and further my career.  Furthermore, I had been given an opportunity to represent the University of West Georgia in India at a conference fall 2020. Due to the second outbreak of Covid the school canceled the trip. I missed out on valuable experiences that could add to my resume. Covid-19 has robbed me of experiences, challenged me with setbacks, and changed my plans, but I am still blessed. I am blessed with health and the gift of life. I thank God that I have never contracted the virus and pray I continue on the path of good health.  ",Yes

I was my Class President for three years, Captain of my basketball team for two years, Student Body President, and Editor-in-Chief of my school newspaper senior year. While all of these activities helped to build my resume, I truly found purpose and fulfillment in each of these individual activities. I could see the impact of my hard work and could not wait until the end of year to lead many of the traditions I had looked forward to since my freshman year. But once the pandemic hit and the slow demise of all my aspirations for senior year crumbled into nothingness, my only lifeline was focusing on the things I could control, which at the moment felt like nothing. These signs of depression carried into my freshman year of college at Villanova. Even though I was finding friends and doing well in all my classes, something seemed to be missing from my life. I couldn't control my emotions as they would fluctuate on an hour to hour basis. I couldn't control my mental health, as I never knew what would push me over the edge. But what I realized I could do was control the impact I could still have on others.  As I started to get more involved in organizations around campus, my brain started to rewire itself. NABA specifically helped me to find the community I was missing. This was evident by our past chapter President, Maria Espinoza, taking me under her wing and eventually preparing me to be Co-President of NABA. Since being in this role, we have hosted a variety of events and have been able to grow our membership because we focused on building genuine connections with our peers.  What I had failed to realize before Covid-19 and before becoming involved at Villanova was that I have an innate desire to impact others. It was never enough for me to just be a student. Being involved and having a say in discussions that advance my educational institutions forward are the things that give me a true purpose that can't be fulfilled through other outlets.  Ultimately, Covid-19 forced me to understand my purpose, and similarly to Villanova's mission, my goal in life is to use my passions to ignite change in the world. Creating a world that fosters equality and justice has motivated me tremendously over the past few years, and knowing that business is a leading driver in that movement, encourages me to become actively involved within that major. I know that will further me along the path of personal growth where I can continue to unearth new ways to connect with people, while also influencing the world around me.  ",Yes

In the spring of 2020, I felt that I was no longer passionate about the work that I was doing in political science. The nature and the curriculum of the work that I had been doing changed because of the pandemic. Fearing the potentially grim prospects of job security out of college, I decided to make the transition to pursue a business major. I had always been interested in business, and I felt led to pursue a career in finance. I believe that the decision was a risky one. School was almost exclusively virtual that year. Furthermore, the first business class that I took was Principles of Accounting. Before this point, I hadn't been accustomed to the differences between virtual and in-person learning. Additionally, I was not aware of the proper study methods necessary to succeed in a class of this caliber. With that being said, I did not pass my first accounting test. I began to feel uneasy and doubt if I could handle the requirements of the new major.   Not only did I have to become acclimated to distance learning, but I also had to learn how to leverage resources and form connections with others in a new college and in a new field. I held no prior connections in the business school, and I had moved back home to my parents' house in Florida when school originally closed. For those students that were around the campus at that time, they were still able to network amongst the local staff and students there. Being brand new to the major and located in another state at the time, I lacked the knowledge, the confidence, and the network to propel myself into better opportunities. I experienced difficulty finding an internship and creating my own personal brand.   The spring semester following my virtual fall semester, I returned to campus and started to attend more organization meetings. Ultimately, things began to shift for me when I was accepted into a program that is called Management Leadership for Tomorrow. This program is designed to assist underrepresented minorities in career preparation and help them elevate as young aspirational professionals. Between MLT and my new connections on campus, I possessed a newfound confidence that allowed me to persevere through the apparent lack of opportunities at the time.   This year, I was able to the land my ideal internship and leverage more professional opportunities through my network. The pandemic complicated the transitional elements of my new career path; however, I am grateful for the grit and the perseverance skills that I was able to develop despite it all. Now, one of the causes most dear to me has been to use my experience to help younger students define their paths and identify their resources.  ",Yes

As Philadelphia went into lockdown, I was confined to my home with my mom, sister, and pets. I was completely uprooted from my sense of normalcy. I lost my routine. I lost my sleep schedule. I lost the opportunities I had to spend time with loved one and to go outside for something simple like small talk with my neighbors.   	At first, I thought being quarantined for two weeks would have been a nice way to maybe catch up on sleep and save money on transportation to school. As time marched forward, I realized that we were living in times that would be covered in history books. I was afraid of the unknown for our future which caused me to have several sleepless nights and moments where I cried because that was the only thing I could control in the chaos.  	This is when I started going to counseling. Through therapy sessions and weekly meditation classes, I learned to nurture my emotions and mindset. I practiced self-care and skills to help live through uncomfortable moments like this. I've learned to combat feelings of anxiety with feelings of love and self-compassion. This has made me a more resilient person and I am so proud to know that I was able to come out of lockdown as a stronger person.

In high school, I would have extreme anxiety around not only talking in front of people but even just being in a room with large amounts of people. I was a graduating senior in high school when Covid-19 made its appearance in the United States, going on spring break to never return into a high school classroom ever again. Covid-19 allowed for me to take a step back and reflect on many things within my life. The summer before entering my freshman year of college I knew that I wanted my college experience to be more impactful and for me to make more connections in getting to know people even if it meant stepping out of my comfort zone. I was very stressed with this thought, especially with being introduced to a pandemic that I did not know anything about at the time besides the spreading cases worldwide.        Once arriving at college I knew that I had to put the goals I set for myself and my growth into action. One advantage that I did have is that my college campus is not extremely large, but just the right size for me. It was a little harder in my very first semester because nearly all of my courses were online, and some hybrid. I went out of my way to schedule face-to-face zoom calls with my professors so that they could put a face to my name and got connected with a few on-campus organizations including NABA.       I am now in my second year of college and the reflection and implementation of my goals that I  put into place during this Covid-19 pandemic have allowed me to become an annual member of our student council at my University, the secretary for my NABA chapter,  an active NAACP member, involved in community service, gaining an internship at an accounting firm within my freshman year of college, and a diversity peer educator on campus. Along with this, I will even be a speaker for the Career Development Conference for my state this year which would have never been possible for me to accomplish before the pandemic started.        Realizing that I have the ability and strength to step out of my comfort zone and accomplish more than my intended goals will forever have a deep lasting impact on me and my future. When most people went through obstacles and struggles during the pandemic I took it as a time for me to grow and prosper and it has paid off in my growth, maturity, and blessings as a person.",Yes

Personally, the pandemic began on a very terrible note as I lost my paternal grandmother and grandfather during the peak of the pandemic. This led me to an incredibly dark place mentally, and it took me some time to get out of it. To add further headache, I am a very extroverted person, so long periods without interaction began to ache at my soul. I get my best work done in collaborative areas, or at the very least I need a period of time away from just work to interact with other people. After a few months of mental darkness, I decided that I wanted to make a change. Just a couple months away from beginning college, I knew that I did not want to enter the next phase of my life weighed down by the depths of emotional baggage To combat these feelings, I decided to begin reading about self-development. The first book that I picked up was ""Awaken the Giant Within"" by Tony Robbins. This was then followed by""Think and Grow Rich"", a book that has quite literally changed the entire trajectory of my life. One book led into another, leading to podcasts, youtube series, and so much more. I became engulfed by the concept of self awareness and learning how to take care of myself mentally, physically, and emotionally. I began forming new habits, such as meditating and daily prayer. These habits pulled me out of an abyss that I thought I would never see the end of. It was during this time where I realized that I did not want to spend my life doing things that did not bring me joy. I wanted to do everything I could to not feel the emotional turmoil I experienced during the beginning of the pandemic. The lessons that I learned during the pandemic has been pivotal to my life for better and for worse.  However, it has really taught me that life is really all about perspective. You never really fail at anything if you gained something from that experience, whether that be a lesson or maybe a series of emotions that help you discover more about yourself. The pandemic has set me on a path of success. I have gained confidence, wisdom, and appreciation to name a few.

In the peak of the pandemic, I also had the opportunity to provide new St. Maarten students mentorship, and housing as they transitioned into their new homes and new normal.

It has affected day-to-day lives and slowed down the global economy. This pandemic has affected thousands of people who are either sick or are being killed due to the spread of this virus. The most common symptoms of this viral infection are fever, cold, cough, bone pain, and breathing problems, ultimately leading to pneumonia. Covid-19 being a new variant of SARS-Cov-2 viruses affecting humans for the first time in January 2020 globally, vaccines were not available.  However, by the inception of Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, etc., income the other life-threatening variants like the Delta, which rapidly became the dominant variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the U.S. in 2021. Then comes the Omicron, the BA.2 sub-lineage of the Omicron variant now makes up nearly a quarter of new COVID-19 infections nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated an up from around 1 in 10 new cases. Since January 2022, Omicron has made up virtually all new infections in the U.S. Like in many countries abroad, most cases in the U.S have been caused by a sub-lineage of Omicron known as BA.1. Thus, the emphasis is on taking extensive precautions such as comprehensive hygiene protocol (e.g., regularly washing of hands, avoidance of face-to-face interaction, etc.), social distancing, wearing of masks, and so on in the earlier inception of this virus. This virus was spreading exponentially region-wise. Countries were banning gatherings of people from spreading and breaking the exponential curve. Many countries were locking down their population and enforcing strict quarantine to control the spread of the havoc of these highly contagious viruses. COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly affected our day-to-day lives and businesses and disrupted world trade and movements. Pinpointing the disease at an early stage should have been crucial in controlling the spread of the virus. Still, it was more of a political spectacle for the President's denial, which caused the virus to very rapidly spread from person to person. The various industries and sectors are affected by the cause of these viruses; these include the pharmaceuticals industry, solar power sector, tourism, Information, and electronics industry. These viruses created significant knock-on effects on the daily life of citizens, as well as on the global economy. Presently the impacts of COVID-19 in our daily lives are extensive and have far-reaching consequences. We are every day trying to deal with the different changes and guidelines set forth by the CDC, the Government, the States, etc. These can be divided into various categories such as Healthcare (overload on doctors and other healthcare professionals, who are at very high risk), Economic (slowing of the manufacturing of essential goods and significant slowing down in the revenue growth), and Social (social distancing with our peers and family members and closure of places for entertainment such as movie and play theatres, sports clubs, gymnasiums, swimming pools, and so on.)",

As it relates to my field of study in Business Administration and my future goals, I had to come to grips that uncertainty can happen. The future is theoretically unknown and changeable, and it's great to prepare, but I realized that I should still be comfortable of the uncertainties. I hone in on the things I can change and I accept the things that I cannot and move forward. Living one day at a time and one moment at a time has girded me with peace. This barrier I overcame has made life more enjoyable. Another area the pandemic has shined light on about me was the impact of personal relationships with friends and colleagues. For a long time, I've taken for granted the ability to see coworkers every day and maybe didn't realize how valuable that was. Most meetings were replaced with tech tools and with less human interaction I was surprised to find myself less content. I realized that involvement with others stimulate me. Supporting others and being there in a way that we can't anymore has made it a barrier. The barrier to connect as we did in the past is now the new normal. I overcome this barrier by staying connected. My contact and talking more often to others is now intentional. This has helped me in seeking opportunities, making a change socially and building new routines. These revelations has made a difference in the person I am today and also made me appreciate interpersonal interaction that interlocks with my personal endeavors.",

Mandatory shutdowns followed by extended periods of quarantine protocols influenced my resourcefulness as a student. Many universities across the nation moved face-to-face courses to an online format. For many students, including myself, this abrupt change created social constraints. It made it difficult to thrive in an isolated environment for my visual and kinetic learning style. I enjoyed the fellowship with classmates as well as being engaged in the lecture, the lack of created some learning barriers that I would not have experienced prior to Covid-19. Being an Accounting student is a great achievement just to mention it. The major and the profession itself are highly respected. Great expectations of academic success accompany the notoriety of this discipline. Adding to the rigor of the program, social distancing created barriers that restricted much needed collaboration with other classmates. In the beginning of the transition to virtual classes, many technological trials created setbacks with staying on track. Many of my courses had multiple deadlines that were not extended to accommodate the delays with the conversion of in person to virtual. I was under a great deal of stress to maintain the path and stay focused despite the many barriers I was faced with. Amid the transition to virtual learning a tragic event happened impacting racial relations in all facets of American society, the murder of George Floyd. This tragedy provoked conversations about racial inequities faced by the Black community. Many higher education institutions across the nation started to implement ""Diversity and Inclusion"" departments to promote strategic initiatives to create an environment of racial equity for minority students. Throughout my academic journey I found myself being the only Black student or one of few in most of my courses. Trying to find connections on campus with students in my major that looked like me was a constant struggle. However, because of the new diversity program, it created more opportunities to network students and even faculty that I wouldn't normally interact with. I attended a virtual seminar called ""Deconstructing Racism"" where the panelists were professors across the university from all disciplines. I had reservations to attend because I felt like it would be just words and no real action to make a change. My attendance had huge impact on my trajectory that brought me to National Association of Black Accountants. A professor on the platform reflected on how the death of George Floyd exposed racial inequities that Black students face. After the seminar I was moved to contact the professor and tell her my challenges. Little did I know, she would be my lifeline and connect me with other Black Accounting students. After my connection, I was able to obtain resources that I needed to be and stay successful. I overcame the obstacles and finished my Undergraduate degree with Honors, and I'm now in a Masters Accounting program.",

As a non-traditional student returning to college, both affected me. In March 2020, I just concluded as a keynote speaker of a regional event. I entered a campaign for an international leadership position with Phi Theta Kappa, an international honor society for two-year colleges. At the beginning of the campaign, I was home with my two sons because we were all in quarantine. I developed an online campaign that started as a two-week campaign but shifted to a month entirely online. I learned that speeches and interviews would have to be online; it heightened my anxiety. Because neither my sons nor I had Covid, my time away from work was unpaid. That added to my financial stress. Being an introvert, you would think I would love to campaign online and not in person but seeing the online comments from others didn't help. Depression and anxiety were one reason I limited my time on social media, but now, I had to post every bit of my life there to win. It was challenging to get people to vote for you if they didn't know anything about you.  	MY DAYCARE FINALLY OPENED UP because I was an essential worker and could return to work. I had to work and be exposed for more than 50 hours per week, maintain good grades, and run an effective campaign. Like many others, I was unsure and afraid to catch this new unknown virus. My fear of contracting it and taking it home to my sons was very high. So high that I had several panic attacks a day just by thinking about it. I began visiting an online doctor for my depression and anxiety. She helped me to deal with the emotions I was feeling. I was one of two African Americans running for the highest student leadership within the Society. I felt the weight of the world on my shoulders. I'm used to feeling that way as a black woman, but this felt much heavier. It was important to win for me, but it was more important to win for my community and the women I represent.  After an exhausting election, I came out the winner. I now had the challenge of making a difference during a pandemic. I continued to work but had to miss several days unpaid due to one or both of my boys being home to quarantine several times throughout the year. Typical travel would have been to visit 3 to 4 regions to speak as a presenter. Over my term, I virtually attended over 100 events, including inductions, regional conferences, workshops, and social media activities. It was a challenging year, but I learned so much about myself and better dealt with my mental health. I became a better leader as I adapted to the changing and new way of communicating. I helped pioneer some of the ideas that continue today throughout the Society.   ",

The year of 2020 was full of situations where I had to demonstrate flexibility and independence in the face of ambiguity. As a college student who was abroad during this period, the isolation and the economic shutdown affected my daily life the most. 	In the spring of 2020, most colleges were forced to pivot their operations entirely online. During that period, I was studying abroad in France. While I was on my way home from school after the closure announcement, I received the news that US restricted all incoming travel from Europe starting the following day. Anxious that the restrictions might keep me from returning home, I had to decide if it was worth taking the risk to travel during a pandemic or stay in isolation until it felt safer to travel back. Additionally, I had to accommodate to the new learning environment in this new country. It became more challenging when I started my summer classes at Baruch College due to the difference in time zone. I had to find innovative ways to interact and participate in the online classes. Nevertheless, after three months in quarantine in France, I had to travel back to the United States because my visa had expired. Coming home was another watershed moment. I had to relocate to Massachusetts with family members due to the scare recourses that I had to support myself. Furthermore, although my internship was not canceled, it shifted to virtual internship and was shortened to two weeks. My financial situation worsens as my only source of income for the summer was strictly limited. The next few months became more difficult as I was relocating to different states to find a permanent residence while being a full-time student. The pandemic helped me understand the importance of being tenacious during those periods of uncertainty. I was fortunate enough to be able to attend two NABA conferences during the crisis. Although the environment was different due to the contact restriction, I managed to find innovative way to contact professionals and make sure that we continue the conversation. I eagerly participated in various workshops led by corporate experts with the focus of developing my professional and technical skills. From Microsoft excel sessions to workshops addressing career paths and time management, I exited every session with newfound knowledge that will forever be applied in my life. Consequently, I was able to receive two internships for the year of 2021 with two different companies. I graduated Baruch College and started my master's in science degree the same year to complete the 150 credit hours required to be eligible to pursue NYS CPA-certification. By the end of the year, I received two full-time offers with two prestigious companies. The years of 2020 and 2021 were a roll coaster of emotions. However, I left those years with many skills and lessons that I can apply to both my personal and my professional life.  ",

Seeing my family after three years was not only refreshing but also surreal. I had tremendously evolved from the woman they knew before; some of my beliefs, fashion and language were detached from the culture I had always called 'home.' As the first daughter to attend college in the US., my family did not understand the anxiety that stemmed from the reversed cultural shock of being back. Struggling to fit in my own culture made it harder to pursue my studies online especially with a nine hour time difference. Although the most challenging part was maintaining good grades to keep my scholarship, it also motivated me to seek professional counseling. 	Going to therapy for the first time was uncomfortable in the beginning because I became conscious of the emotions I harbored inside for a long time.

It has disrupted so many people's lives. The truth of the matter is, I can not only talk about one challenge or barrier I have faced when it comes to Covid-19 because it has affected every aspect of my life. Throughout my college career I have held multiple jobs, including some at the same time. Since covid hit, I have had to adjust in school, work, and in family life. In school covid caused most of our academic studies to go online. This was difficult because the teaching styles and even how test were taken changed drastically, I had little to no time to figure out how to still be successful in my schooling without ever being in physical contact with the teacher. I am a very hands-on learner and have been accustomed to having a good working relationship with all my professors. It was important for me to continue to work towards a hands-on environment and building relationships with professors. The best way for me to continue to do well was to keep meeting with my professors for extra virtual study sessions and make sure that they knew that I was determined to do well. I have had the opportunity to hold multiple jobs throughout my college career, from working in the housing department, chick-fil-a, and having two accounting internships. I will say that working in the fast-food industry was affected by covid the most. I went from serving customers face-to-face to having to learn how to social distance while taking orders and shutting down the dinning room completely. It effected customers because of the service that they are used to having from chick-fil-a and it affected us as employees more because less people were allowed to be in the store which meant that it would be harder to accumulate the amount of work hours that you are normally accustomed to working. I served as a manager when covid first hit and having to adjust to all the covid restrictions while still trying to have good sales and fast service was proven to be very difficult. I am proud to say that my store adjusted accordingly and even increased sales. Any barriers that I have had to overcome dealing with Covid and my family would be being able to go home. In college I am around so many people and could easily be exposed to Covid-19. To protect my parents, I would often refrain from going home without testing to make sure I wasn't exposing them to COVID. I couldn't see my family as much which became difficult because they hold a major place in my life, and they motivate me to work hard in school. All in all, Covid -19 has affected millions of people in more ways than one. It is important to me to continue to work hard and give my all to my education because I still desire to achieve the academic goals I set before Covid. ",Yes

For example, I remember begging my supervisor to let me take my break later so I could take my final presentation in the bathroom at work and I still managed to get a A plus.

The start of a new decade, January 1st, 2020, was going to be my year of traveling, exploring, career growth, and much more.  Little did I know that 2020 was going to be my greatest downfall.  Working 40+ hour work weeks soon came to a halt in March as the organization I was contracted to work for shifted their office employees to work from home due to the threat of the coronavirus.  I managed the catering division for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's DC office. I was a team of 1 and had over 300 potential clients to manage and keep satisfied.  I was told by my management company that I will be back in the office soon, just enjoy my time off at the moment.  After a much-needed break from waking up at 4 am to have breakfasts set up by 6:45 am, I enjoyed my week off.  A week turned into two, two turned into a month and one month turned into two.  Week after week I would check in with my management company as to what the next steps would be, they assured me things were fine and my job was secure.  After a while, I stopped hearing from my manager and at that moment, I knew I was no longer employed.  On the ""bright side"" I qualified for unemployment benefits. On the not-so-bright side, it was eight months before I received a payment. Being trapped in the house for months on end gave me a lot of alone time with my thoughts. I felt so silly being a servant in the hospitality industry for almost 10 years. Every week I read articles about how more service workers were fired, laid-off, and faced significant hour reductions by their employers who were receiving bailout funding from the government.  It disgusted me because as an unemployed citizen where was my bailout?  I had an understanding that businesses know the risk of operating said business, that they may face a decline in growth.  I didn't understand why multi-million-dollar businesses received a massive amount of bail-out funding while still letting go of employees by the dozens.  I made a vow to never be at the mercy of employers again.  I decided to go back to school, finish my degree but in business this time.  So, I majored in finance- it's been my saving grace.  Learning about conducting due diligence when analyzing security investments and the concept time value of money is key to financial wellness. Growing up financial literacy was one of the many things not talked about in my household, so I decided it is time to obtain that knowledge by any means necessary.  I am overcoming the absence of knowledge. I'm learning that the more you know, the more you'll grow- physically, mentally, and emotionally. As I learn the former unknown, I can envision an optimal plan for success. The plan is to break the generational curses of financial and social inequity.",Yes

For the past two summers of quarantine, I have competed and worked under her program that provides youth with entrepreneurial job experiences. My first year I was assigned to a company called Moves and Grooves. Dr. Mitchell, owner of Moves and Grooves, was a very driven and outgoing woman. She single handedly changed my outlook on Nashville and how much so few people could accomplish. My first public appearance under her teaching was in a barbershop right next door to her building. I forced myself to say, ""My name is Mario Wilson. I work with Moves and Grooves and we plan to build a MAG arts center for the youth in Antioch. Would anyone be willing to donate to our cause!"" Following the conclusion of my nervous business pitch, the barbershop erupted in loud applause and praises. I was so self conscious about my pitch, yet everyone in the shop was happy to see young black entrepreneurs doing something positive in our community for a change. This inspired me to want to bring something extraordinary to my hometown. Dr. Mitchell made me just as prideful in Nashville as she was by the end of the program. After six short weeks, my brilliant team and I met with dozens of big-time investors across Nashville, created building plans with the Bauer Askew Architecture firm, and even raised thousands of dollars from crowdfunding and the Nashville Predators ice hockey team. During this Covid-19 pandemic I found a part of me I never knew I had. Deep down in my core I am willing to fight for something I believe in despite my social anxiety. Dr. Mitchell, owner of Moves and Grooves, taught me the resourcefulness and cunningness required to bring any dream into fruition. Dr. Mitchell was able to embed into me, the heart of an entrepreneur. Her love for her community seeped into me.  This core memory of mine easily powered one of the brightest and most resilient personality islands in my mind.  ",

One of, the most challenging aspects for me was physically going to college. I enjoy interacting with my friends and getting involved with campus. Furthermore, I experienced financial hardships, which affected my personal life and studies. These disruptions have hence changed the whole aspect of learning.  Reducing social and physical interaction because of Covid-19 was mentally exhausting. Hence, schools had to adapt hybrid learning that incorporated fewer physical classes. As an individual who enjoys learning and the social aspect of school, I found it hard to adapt to this kind of learning. Most of my friends are my college mates. Therefore, when we were asked not to go to college to reduce the spread of the virus, my social life was affected. In addition to this, my study life was also affected. I like to do most of my revision in group discussions. They help me understand other students' perspectives of the class. With no more group discussions, I had to work harder in my studies. There were platforms where we could conduct virtual discussions, but they were not as effective as physical meetings. Despite this, I taught myself how to integrate online discussion into learning by using platforms like zoom that allowed me to see my classmates. Apart from Virtual discussions, I also had to adapt to virtual learning. At first, I found it hard to manage my time for my virtual classes. This is because every family member was working from home. Hence, it was hard to maintain family responsibilities and have time for my school work. The hardest part of virtual learning came when doing exams. If the system logs you out in most of these exams without completing them, it is hard for you to continue with the exam. Hence, every time my attention was divided between the exam and the constant worry that I might experience a technical issue during the exam. Apart from the virtual integration of the classes that came with covid 19, the pandemic made it hard to find an extra job. These extra jobs help me sustain my financial needs during school work. When the pandemic hit, I was forced to use all my savings to make ends meet. This got me worried because I was unsure how to get the extra books needed in class. With time, the virtual aspect of jobs proved beneficial to me. I found that I could make extra money by working online, which paid for my expenses. All in all, despite taking time to adapt to the changes that came with covid 19, I think I can confidently say that I have overcome the challenges. I am learning to adapt to new technology easily and being more open-minded during learning. Now, the hybrid learning method has become the new norm. It has helped me learn how to manage my time more effectively and integrate different ways of learning.    ",Yes

The Covid-19 pandemic has shown people across the world how adaptable we all are to difficult circumstances. For example, corporate employees have proven that they can be trusted to do their jobs efficiently within their own discretion. In higher education, students have proven their commitment to education in a time where the value of said education is in question. With the good things that people have proven in the past two years there have also been a multitude of struggles they have had to overcome. Navigating intentional solidarity out of concern for others' health has debilitated many across the world and has been my biggest challenge for the past two years.  Adapting to life away from friends and family was a challenge before the shutdown halfway through my second semester in Spring 2020. Prior to pandemic shutdowns, I became secluded in my studies after struggling to find a community within honors societies and other groups on campus. I was disappointed in the lack of community activity from the on-campus groups. I had hoped to find an organization whose impact was more than a bullet point on a resume, an organization who granted the opportunity to impact others' lives through participation. My search for such a community was disrupted by our campus pandemic shutdown. My life became increasingly sedentary out of concern for the safety of my family that summer. That sedentary lifestyle accentuated the loneliness I faced in my single room on campus Fall 2020. Out of caution for catching Covid-19 I hardly left my room, only making an exception for getting food. I found comfort in being secluded and I found no group important enough to leave that comfort for. The turning point of my pandemic experience was receiving an invitation to lead the founding of a Mississippi State NABA Chapter. To me this opportunity was a chance to create the community I had been searching for in my first year at Mississippi State.  Those I met in my first Executive meeting as the founding secretary was the first such group of professional minority students I had met on campus. As a sophomore I was impressed by the steadfast confidence our upperclassmen leadership had in achieving the direction we wanted for the organization. I looked forward to those once-a-month meetings where we discussed everything we wanted for NABA and our own careers. Our general body meeting speakers were truly inspiring in describing their growth from college. Questioning their experiences inspired a direction for my career. Talking to other minority business students going through the same experiences and working to achieving goals for my future helped me to overcome Covid-19 isolation.  A year removed from overcoming Covid-19 solidarity I am President of the Mississippi State Chapter currently establishing professional connections for the minority business students and developing a community for students to be candid about their experiences at the university.",

Covid 19 came at a time that I was taking pre-requisite classes to get into my program. I personally knew that the pandemic was serious, but I did not anticipate that schools will be closed, and we will have to transition to be fully virtual. I consider myself a person who learns better when am hands on with activities or have at least a little human interaction. A barrier I had to overcome during the Covid 19 pandemic was transitioning from face-to-face learning to distance learning. Online classes take place through the internet. It is a platform where both the students and teachers participate over the internet. They are usually run through a learning management system, which allows students to ask lecturers questions about their syllabus and other school related things, as well as well as communicate with other students. The typical on-campus classroom experience on the other hand, is one in which you attend classes in person at a physical place and meet with other students.  One of the biggest challenges I faced was keeping myself motivated. I start off really enthused, but life got in the way after a week or two and I started slacking off. When this happens, I have to remind myself that am in charge of my success and in other to succeed I have to keep myself motivated and prioritize school. Another challenge I faced was time management, it can get very easy to push back things that I scheduled, miss study sessions, or even forget something that is due in the class. I had to figure out a way to stick to my schedule by having someone to remind me, I also had different reminders and checking the school website every day for any updates really helped me keep up. In addition, to staying motivated and managing time, another challenge I faced during distance learning is being proactive. In a traditional class, students will normally go to class and the lecturer will go over the topic for the day, but in a remote setting since there is not a set time for the classes the student will have to use the materials provide by the lecturer to teach themselves and might even have to take an extra step of going outside the class materials to search for further help. Going on google or searching for help on YouTube has really help me a lot. After a couple of semesters of distance learning, I have been able to overcome these challenges and thrive in my classes.       ",

One of the core skills I have had to develop is the ability to adapt to change. We have all experienced change to some effect during this period and some of it may not have been pleasant. A situation that comes to mind is when I had just graduated from my undergrad program with a Bachelor of Science in Data Analytics. I felt ready to enter the workplace but jobs were few and far between in an economy that was tanking heavily during the peak of the pandemic (mid-2020). There were many instances during that time where I had lost hope of finding a job let alone being able to pursue my dreams having traveled thousands and thousands of miles to study in lands afar and chase my American dream. Another important point to note during that time is the amount of social awareness that was going on. That period was a reflective period where I reminisced on times where I had been unjustly treated. I realized that at times I had condoned unfair behavior just because no one would speak out against it. During this time I develop skills to stand up and speak for myself and for those whose voices might be cut out. There is still an incredibly long journey to go but I am happy that more institution are becoming more and more aware about the disparities faced by minorities and are doing intentional acts to help aid diversity.,

When the pandemic started, the entire economy as a whole came to a halt and employers had no option but to let go of some of their employees. There was no limit to which type of industries were affected, I knew people that were laid off in the tech field, health sector, etc.. Although, I had firsthand experience with this as my mother was let go from her hospital job due to insufficient wages for employees. This was the year that I was going to start attending college, I had just got accepted  to the University of Georgia and I was ecstatic for my journey to start. Although, my dreams of being a college student were almost shattered due to financial circumstances. At this point in time, my dad was the sole worker in the household and he was not at a fiscal status that would enable me to attend the University. My parents were against loans as they did not want me to accumulate debt at school so I had to find a way to help fund my professional education. Therefore, I started working at Walmart the next week. The pandemic was a great time for me in terms of working because I was able to finish out my senior year virtually while I worked every day from 2pm-8pm. My memories from quarantine only consist of stocking products and helping customers but I persevered through it because of the goal I wanted to attain. From March 2020- August 2020, I was able to accumulate enough money to attend the University of Georgia for my freshman year without my parents' assistance. Not only did this bring me a feeling of success but it helped me realize that I am the only one responsible for my future so I need to take action in order to get there.  ",

Isolation, contact restrictions, and economic shutdown impose a complete change to the psychosocial environment in all countries.   Like individuals, I have faced challenges in my personal and business routine due to the pandemic. Firstly, the death of my grandmother. My grandmother did not die from complications of the virus, but the loneliness of not seeing her close family that visited her on a routine basis. My grandmother suffered from dementia and lived in her home in the British Virgin Islands with a caretaker, where our family would visit her on a daily and weekly basis. When the pandemic hit the islands, the country closed its borders. It was unfortunate because the closure took place when none of the close family members were in the country. My grandmother asking for us to come but because of the closure, we could not. She felt abandoned and therefore died with only the caregiver present.   Because the country was closed, my grandmother's body lay in the morgue for two months. Eventually, we entered the country to prepare her funeral. When we arrive, we had to quarantine for two weeks in a hotel paid for by the government. At first, it sounded like a doable idea, staying in a hotel for two weeks, eating 3 square meals, and just relaxing. It was a mental and anguishing experience. Upon arrived in the country, we were escorted from the aircraft to a wooden stand and then shuttled to the hotel in a taxi. Once at the hotel, my family was separated which resulted in me in a room with my toddler for two weeks with no internet, cable nor satellite and could not leave the room under no circumstances. Eventually, we were released from being quarantined and began to organize and plan the funeral and give my grandmother a proper burial.  The next challenge I faced due to this pandemic was the client visits that I have each quarter. My clients are in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and I reside in Florida; I would do a face-to-face visit with them each quarter. Unfortunately, I had to cancel my travels because some of my clients were not vaccinated and/or refused to wear their masks. My daughter is a toddler and is not eligible for the vaccine and I did not want to get infected bring home the virus to her. So, I've resorted to doing zoom calls and conducting board meetings with my clients.    The future remains uncertain, and I know that I am not in a unique situation by any means with the challenges faced. However, and because of the pandemic, we all must adjust, but adjusting sometimes takes us out of our comfort zone.   Finally, due the steps I took to protect myself and from others from the pandemic, my existing customers referred me out to other potential customers. Hopefully, this will bring more business and help me branch off on my own.  ",

Okonjo Iweala, the current Director of World Trade Organization, was the charismatic personality my Economics Teacher in High School said I would be like. She had spoken about women in Nigeria taking over their finances and stance and I found myself wanting to help women on that journey. It was one of the reasons I chose to study Accounting as an undergraduate student. While these comments were seemingly harmless, they internally gave me burdens that I did not know how to empty.  Although it's a beautiful goal I had outlined, it came with a lot of anxiety, sleepless night and pressure to be this ""excellent representation"". I never really sat with my feelings, I just prayed, did my routines and moved to the next class or do whatever I needed to complete. I remember while as an undergrad, all I wanted to do was graduate but after graduation especially during covid, I felt this deep emptiness nothing else could fill. I was doing well in classes but wasn't really learning and assimilating the material. Yes, I oversaw many organizations on campus and did everything to the best of my abilities. I even got an award for excellence, but I was sad, depressed and felt alone. Worse, I had Covid, the deadly-killing virus that left me with a long-lasting brain fog. It was at that moment, I decided to slow down. I began questioning every single decision I have made. It was then I decided to see a therapist.  While reexamining what matters, which is the gift of life, I decided to treat myself with more kindness. I have always been in the mode of ""unto the next"", during my educational growth but now I am learning to live in the moment and focus on my life motto: ""being intentional about loving people and myself"".  My therapist said, ""Mirabel, it is wonderful that you have these goals, but you cannot not lift others as you climb if you have not learned to carry yourself up first"". It was so freeing to deeply understand that. As I healed physically from covid, I healed emotionally and mentally. The importance of mental health could no longer be underestimated. I had to share what I learned in therapy with other women that were also struggling with their mental health. I created a group chat to support young adults fighting the emptiness they feel.

Okonjo Iweala, the current Director of World Trade Organization, was the charismatic personality my Economics Teacher in High School said I would be like. She had spoken about women in Nigeria taking over their finances and stance and I found myself wanting to help women on that journey. It was one of the reasons I chose to study Accounting as an undergraduate student. While these comments were seemingly harmless, they internally gave me burdens that I did not know how to empty.  Although it's a beautiful goal I had outlined, it came with a lot of anxiety, sleepless night and pressure to be this ""excellent representation"". I never really sat with my feelings, I just prayed, did my routines and moved to the next class or do whatever I needed to complete. I remember while as an undergrad, all I wanted to do was graduate but after graduation especially during covid, I felt this deep emptiness nothing else could fill. I was doing well in classes but wasn't really learning and assimilating the material. Yes, I oversaw many organizations on campus and did everything to the best of my abilities. I even got an award for excellence, but I was sad, depressed and felt alone. Worse, I had Covid, the deadly-killing virus that left me with a long-lasting brain fog. It was at that moment, I decided to slow down. I began questioning every single decision I have made. It was then I decided to see a therapist.  While reexamining what matters, which is the gift of life, I decided to treat myself with more kindness. I have always been in the mode of ""unto the next"", during my educational growth but now I am learning to live in the moment and focus on my life motto: ""being intentional about loving people and myself"".  My therapist said, ""Mirabel, it is wonderful that you have these goals, but you cannot not lift others as you climb if you have not learned to carry yourself up first"". It was so freeing to deeply understand that. As I healed physically from covid, I healed emotionally and mentally. The importance of mental health could no longer be underestimated. I had to share what I learned in therapy with other women that were also struggling with their mental health. I created a group chat to support young adults fighting the emptiness they feel. We shared multiple podcasts, songs, books like ""Cleaning Your Mental Mess"" by Dr Caroline Leaf, ""Set Boundaries, Find Peace"" by Nedra Tawwab and many more.

Before the pandemic, I was a junior in high school, and as most know, that means that it's one of the hardest moments in my academic college career. So, to make sure that I would be accepted into every school that I applied to, I decided to overpack my schedule, even more than usual, so that college admissions would see that I am a ""well-rounded"" individual.  That meant I had a class every period of the day, I was involved in two sports; lacrosse and track, and I still helped to facilitate a few clubs, while working a part-time job and maintaining a high average. Let's just say when the pandemic shut everything down, it finally gave me a second to breathe, which helped me to acknowledge the cyclical life pattern that I had accidentally put myself in. I realized that my day was school, sports, and clubs, job, homework, sleep repeat, and that just wasn't a fun way to live. In addition to that, the pandemic helped me to acknowledge that I had been neglecting relationships in my life as a result of being too busy, and I wanted to fix it. In all honestly, it was really hard for me to break through the aspect of being busy since, at this point, it had been at least half a year with a packed schedule. However, the shutdown forced me to acknowledge that there's more to life than things you are involved in, and although education is extremely important, it shouldn't just be the center of your life overall. Furthermore, it helped me to remember that one, you should always make time for the things you care about, and two, that life isn't about how much you can accomplish, or the number of your involvements, but instead pursuing something that truly matters to you, and giving that aspect in your life the best you can give. I am so happy that I was able to learn to not overbook myself but make a difference in areas that are imperative to me, while also maintaining any interpersonal relationships I have formed.  ",Yes

I had never had an online class, which was a challenge I knew I had to overcome. My home was not the most conducive learning environment, as I did not have a desk or workplace of my own to complete my classes. I set up a makeshift workspace in our living room, as this was the only space with a table long enough for all my schoolwork and laptop. Learning remotely also created a challenge I did not expect, as I became more aware of home situations and how my family was managing everything. I watched my mom work endless hours, despite the uncertain, dynamic times, to provide for me and my sister. I could not shake this concern for all that she was balancing alone, so I made the decision to find work to help support my mom and myself, and I got a job at Walmart. Working at Walmart during a pandemic was very challenging to say the least. I appreciated the financial aspect but having to wear a mask for over eight hours a day and interacting with customers who often were abrasive and confrontational was challenging. Customers were yelling because of the strict rules being enforced, such as limitations on the number of cases of water a person could buy and having limited stock on certain supplies. I also only took a thirty-minute lunch instead of a full hour because we were understaffed. My time at Walmart shaped me as a person, allowing me to hone my skills relative to customer service and patience, and I appreciate my time there. Before this time, I never had a job during the school year, so juggling classes with work was something new to me during an already unprecedented time. There were times when I had to request a new exam date due to my work schedule, but the teachers were understanding during this time and worked with me. I appreciated their flexibility, as the pandemic began to be the new norm, and we were all trying to figure out what to do and how to navigate during this challenging time. Even though I faced a few challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, they made me into the strong, resilient person I am today. ",

It was during this critical time I was starting my full five-year accelerated program that I found myself struggling to manage a four-credit biology class on top of a fully loaded schedule. It was difficult to manage deadlines and try to meet the obligations of my job prior to the onset of the pandemic; the shift in my daily life completely took me to my surprise. I found out my job could not support all its employees and I was laid-off. My main source of income was now gone leaving me in a panic to find ways to cover bills and daily living costs. When the school switched to virtual learning, the added stress of trying to manage classes that weren't compatible with an online setting. Working through technical errors and distractions left me burnout. With my family crammed under one roof, working from home, I found it challenging to find a quiet to study and focus on my classes. I soon became frustrated and anxious about my academic performance and lost motivation, which was reflected in my schoolwork and test grades. Adding onto this, I found my free time being less productive as I focused more on the news and social media. This overconsumption of both outlets disadvantaged me. I grew depressed and unable to really focus on anything other than the negative. Stayed holed up in my room, I was absorbed in anxious, racing thoughts about the pandemic, the shortages, losing my job, and my declining grades.   It was a struggle to stay positive when there were so many negative things going on at one time. I found that overcoming this challenge wasn't easy. It wasn't something I could fix in a day or even a week. It was a constant battle to get back to where I was before the Pandemic. Even then, it is still not the same. I found that cutting down my time on social media really helped me to not dwell on pessimistic thoughts that distracted me from bettering myself. I gave myself screen breaks from technology and focused on doing physical activity like weight lifting or walking the dog. I found spending time with my family helped increase my mood. We were able to play board games and talk about things that worried or concerned us. Being able to share my thoughts helped improved my mood. As far as school, I made a schedule of when I would study and do assignments so that way I wouldn't overwork myself. By changing my schedule around, I found I had more time to grasp concepts which help improve my scores. This challenge taught me the importance of putting myself first. I realized that there will be bad days and they will come and go, but they are not forever. Learning to cope in a healthy way taught me how to deal with life's toughest issues.  ",Yes

Through this phenomenon I had emotional setbacks that took a toll on my academics and relationships around me. It's harder to suppress my emotional composure almost as if they held in but the more I had done it the worse my situation became. My sheer determination to attain the goals I set out for myself only came after reeling over my memories. They were far too short but meant the world to me. My father was a great man of technology precision, fondness of nature, and bountiful love he gave my brother and me. He may have not been a part of my life and as supportive as my mother, but he made it up in the little acknowledgements he did. One thing he always did was take me and my brother to class on the first day of school from elementary to high school. Also when we visited him in New York he took us to see the parks, museums and restaurants foreign to a resident from Georgia. He was in no way an expert golfer since I've beaten him more than once but he treasured golfing. He and my mother had traveled and collected golf balls from mostly every state and now I have his trophy cabinet to remember him by. I even remember how contentedly he'd express his stories of where and how he got each one. Following his passing, was my aunt Irene. She inspired me to not only play the piano but achieve the greatest for my future because I deserved it. She was a strong and inspiring woman who never doubted her decisions with a doctorate degree and list of certificates to prove it. She always stood her ground in family quirks or demeaning incidents that would break down a normal individual. And always supported my family especially through my fathers death. I always felt that If I needed to make a decision and couldn't go to my mother, she was the next best supportive figure that wouldn't shame nor bash my thinking. Despite these circumstances, I've maintained an exceptional G.P.A., stayed academically focused and had participated in extracurriculars that would benefit me in my field of expertise such as the Accounting Club and the National Association of Black Accountants. And I'd also worked throughout highschool and now through college on top of this. Furthermore, the NABA Scholarship will help me alter my life and achieve the goals I've set for myself at a faster rate. And because money has played a role in every decision I've made during my time at West Georgia, having that burden lifted would have a major impact on my life. I will also continue putting forth the same amount of effort into my collegiate studies as I have in the past, prioritizing education and dedication to others, and doing my best to represent your organization through my undergraduate years and beyond if selected.",Yes

Wells Fargo, San Francisco, RBC Capital, San Francisco",No,No,,No,,No,,"Beginning my college experience amid a pandemic was nothing short of a challenge and even more so a heartbreak when my school decided to cancel all in-person classes in just 3 weeks due to the spread of the pandemic. However my optimism is not something easily taken from me, I made it a priority to make the most of my situation and sought out opportunities that would prepare me for the desired end goal of working in the financial services industry alongside real estate. During my time away from campus I would attend classes online that started at 5 am, then actively attend the school's real estate organization meetings where I was able to build a foundational network that would later serve me. With all of my classes complete by 1 pm, I had incredible amounts of free time that I leveraged to meet with industry professionals in my network and then land an internship with a local mortgage bank that eventually led to a full-time position after I became licensed. There is where I saw tremendous growth in myself, by managing a full-time job and maintaining a full course load I became more confident in my ability to learn quickly, adapt, and manage multiple tasks at once. By keeping the perspective that challenges are opportunities to improve I was able to overcome many things during this period.  Upon returning on campus, hopefully, this time to stay, I was faced with a different set of challenges. Hailing from a small 400 student Richmond California high school and now attending Temple University in Philadelphia with over 20,000 students can certainly cause you to stand out and need to adjust, in that time I realized I was truly out on my own. I had no good grace to fall on but instead had to create a name and goodwill for myself. I began with seeking out a leadership position in the real estate organization I was active in previously. After completing that goal I realized that the organization lacked representation of students of color. Outside of connecting with the BSU and NAACP chapter on campus I received the most support and connection from the NABA organization where I was able to connect with board members to coordinate joint meetings between the organizations bringing not only more representation into the real estate organization but also internship opportunities to black students. I now have become more involved in the organization through assisting the creation of an annual black conference held here at our school where president Guylaine Saint Juste will be our first honorary guest.  The past year was filled with challenges; a virtual freshman year, maintaining an 8 hour job along with school, returning to campus alone, and finding ways to create a diverse environment have all been challenges that I feel speak to my character and ability to thrive despite circumstances. I look forward to continuing to build my character and helping others succeed alongside me. ",Yes

It is so easy to ignore your responsibilities when you are no longer required to see them everyday. Covid-19 put me out of work, put my schooling online and required me to stay in my room for the majority of my days. This environment put me in a very unhealthy mindset that was hard to overcome because there was no one or anything to really help me get myself out of that state. There was nothing encouraging me to do anything other than indulge in my hobbies and sleep. The only thing that helped me maintain my responsibilities was my drive to achieve and work. I am not the kind of person who can indulge in their hobbies and sleep all day, so my only other option, if I did not want to sit around and think of nothingness, was to focus my mind on productive activities such as school work and finding jobs on campus. I filled my days with two jobs, extracurricular activities and school. I did all that I could to force myself out of bed and back into regular daily activities before the pandemic. It took a lot of adjusting and I am very thankful that college was so considerate because of the circumstances or else I may not have done as well. My mom was also a driving factor in motivating me, because she is always my motivation to do well. My main goal in life is to make her proud and succeed enough to support her. This of course encouraged me to do my best academically and get myself out of my bed most days. There were some days when I would want to call out of work or quit and other days when all I could do was hope I could find a reason to leave my room. Once you are forced to stay away from people in every manner, it has a very big effect. People are meant to interact in some capacity or else we did not perform well in any areas of our lives.This barrier greatly affected my bigger challenge of acknowledging my responsibilities because I wanted to interact with others, but when everyone you get to speak to is on your computer screen it makes wanting to interact far less appealing. I started to lose my confidence in speaking with others and had to learn to get over new insecurities, such as speaking more clearly or wearing a mask before I left my room because all of this was such a big part of our lives. Acknowledging my responsibilities was, and can sometimes be, a very significant challenge but I have learned how to handle that feeling and control it because my desire to live happily and accomplish my goals trumps a temporary feeling of relief I get when I ignore the important things that I sometimes forget bring me joy.

The first few weeks was a constant struggle with unstable internet connections, creating two new work areas, and working around each other's schedules.    One of the biggest and most unexpected challenges that I experienced during the pandemic was a severe drop in motivation and self-discipline. I have always been a strong and disciplined student. Oftentimes, I scored the highest on my tests and could easily answer my peer's questions about difficult concepts within a course.

Without these things, I did not feel fulfilled as a student and this began to manifest in many ways, like decreased participation in classes.  Though I managed to maintain good grades during the pandemic, I found that I was not actually retaining the material like I should. I was not engaged the same way that I was when classes were in-person. Once I realized why I wasn't feeling motivated, I began to brainstorm ways to address the issue. I realized that a key to building discipline was having a routine. So, I made a new daily schedule for myself. I incorporated exercise and yoga into my daily routines to become more active. I adopted new hobbies like taking care of plants and learning to crochet to fill my newfound free time. I made sure to include time to talk to friends because it was no longer possible to have random conversations in the hallway or hang out in our dorms. My new routine made me feel more in-control of my time, which improved my motivation levels. This resulted in better performance and engagement within my classes.   The pandemic has been a journey of personal growth. Though I still struggle with self-discipline and motivation, I have developed healthy habits to work through these issues. Since being back in-person at school, I have also been re-learning important time-management skills. I am back to juggling multiple responsibilities, from leading organizations to cooking for my family and making time for friends. Each week, I notice that I am better prepared for my classes. I am also arriving at work on time and packing food to keep me energized for a busy day away from the house. These skills will be crucial to my success when I begin the Master of Science in Business Analytics at Wake Forest University this summer.  ",Yes

My grandparents are very strong and loving people and it hurt to see them scared. It was weird to also be feeling that fear at the same time and try to not react in the way that would let them know just how scared I was. Like so many people during that time, I realize that tomorrow is never promised. Still there was a fear that this decision would lead me to not see my grandparents during a time where the elderly were one of the most affected. Still, I decided that if something were to occur, I knew my grandparents wouldn't want me to see them that way and I could not deal with the guilt of possibly being the cause of them catching the virus. So, I decided to take a leap.  I transferred to the University of Central Florida five hours away from my hometown. My first instinct when I came down here was the fine familiarity and making friends with something that was a number one priority in my journey to hang onto what was once ""normal"". I was asked to be the secretary of NABA and came in with a lot of ambitious of ideas on how we can grow membership, open the club to all students in business, be more known in the school. Unfortunately for me, I learned that at the end of the day in organization is simply a group of people and the whole world of people was going through trauma, so it was so understandable that the club's activity was close to non-existent. Readjusting my expectations was not something I decided to do it solely based on my own observations. From the beginning I knew that I needed to get in contact with the members who have been there before me as I was only a sophomore at the time, a new transfer to the school, and practically knew nothing about accounting at all meanwhile there were people going for their master's in accounting. So, I decided that I would contact every member individually and let everyone have my phone number. One day, I had a call with a member, and he brought to my attention as I was sharing with him my ideas that the beauty of Naba is that it is a close-knit community where people can be around people from their community and who are in similar situations as them. He put an emphasis on working with the members that we have now and on finding value within the club rather than searching for value outside of it. That was both humbling and something that I feel I will continue to carry with me as I remember to lift as I climb. To see who's on the same ladder and start with them. ",Yes

I am a very meticulous person who often organizes how, when and what things need  to be completed. However, there were two experiences that taught me preparing is no good if one can not pivot. The first being my island, Grand Bahama,  in 2019 being struck by category 5 in August of 2019 , which was the beginning of my freshman term in a new country, miles away. This devastating storm left not only my island, but the entire Bahamas in turmoil as there were both losses of life and property. Even today, the effects of this storm are very recognizable. My family lost everything physical in their home and I knew that it would not be long before they may have to make a financial decision regarding my education as they had to rebuild their lives. This experience pushed me into being a more independent individual and helped me to come out of my comfort zone to land my first job. While things began to look hopeful, it would not be long before Covid-19 began spreading rampantly and left many without jobs. In the Bahamas, we were not at a technical advantage near the beginning of the pandemic to shift to work from home, therefore a lot of establishments remained closed, which meant for me once again, that I would face another financial challenge. This encouraged me to study harder and continue to seek scholarship opportunities which gave me the opportunity to be one of the 2021 recipients of the NABA scholarship.  While these situations challenged me in ways unimaginable, they forced me to bring out and build a stronger side of meâ€“ one that can take on any challenge and make it work in my favor, or as we say in The Bahamas, ""make something shake.""

A few hours later we were also aware that our competition was canceled for the following week, which was the only thing we had practiced and prepared for the past eight months. Heartbreaking as it was, I returned to school and packed my things as instructed. Immediately all classes were to be held virtually, and for me, that was each one of my classes. Transitioning to virtual classes was a challenge for me because I am a visual and interactive learner. Not only is it hard to stay focused and pay attention to zoom, but it is also even harder to ask questions to the professor and get an explanation that I could understand. I have always preferred to learn accounting in person just because of the amount of time and detail that it requires. At times I found myself teaching trying to teach myself new materials and difficult concepts. It forced me to study in a different way and approach the problems differently. It also showed me that this is not the way I want to learn as I felt it would harm me in the future. I try to use all of my accounting courses as study guides for the CPA exam and I just didn't feel like I was getting the proper instruction virtually.

One thing guaranteed from this historical event is that things would never be the same again as the once used to be. I would like to also share some of the positive aspects of a global pandemic. First, I think situations like the one we are living bring out the worst and the best of human interactions. As someone who has lived in Lagos, Nigeria for the majority of my life and now live in Houston, I loved the less traffic the city experienced which caused less pollution in the air quality. I believe nature has benefited from a decline in actions that hurt our environment. This experience has also taught me to enjoy the little thing in life that we take for granted. I learned that adapting is the best form of survival, I cannot predict what the future but I'm certain whatever it would be, I would do my best to enjoy every single minute of it. I am a strong believer the human spirit is capable of creating positive change and I'm sure we will overcome this situation. Last summer in my neighborhood and during the pandemic, I taught some kids with special needs how to ride bicycles and it was a rewarding experience especially since motor skills can be a real challenge and are of special difficulty for special children, as regular childhood activities can be harder for them to get the hang of. Next summer I plan to partner with some parents in our neighborhood to create a ""free"" minicamp that will focus on teaching more children how to ride bikes. Our objective is for children in the neighborhood to form friendships, learn new abilities, and generally just spend some quality time with their peers. These bike riding activities by themselves can help improve children's areas of difficulties, and everything's going to be under the supervision of appropriate & qualified people of course. This experience and recent research validated my fears about the underreported additional consequences of the pandemic. Roughly 5.2 million children around the world have lost a parent or caregiver to Covid-19, according to a study published in the Lancet Child & Adolescent Health medical journal, a figure that dramatically accelerated as the pandemic continued leaving many of the world's most vulnerable people without the support or resources they need as existing care systems struggle to cope. The estimate is based on modeling of mortality data from 20 countries including the U.S., England, India and Peru from March 2020 to October 2021. The research further reported that Three out of four children who lost a parent to Covid during the pandemic lost their father, the study found, which the researchers said is in line with a trend towards later fatherhood and the increased risk of Covid-19 in older people. I believe more research need to be done that can guide government policies to address this problem.    ",

I was going through a storm, but I was determined that I would not let anything make me drown because I now know who I am because of those disruptions.   Covid-19 changed my life in every dimension that I did not know life could actually turn. My mentality and philosophy of life were shaken and tested. A GLOBAL PANDEMIC 2 years after arriving in the USA from Nigeria. I was devastated, this was different from the regular struggle I faced in Africa. I came here for better education and financial security. I was on the path to achieving that, but March 2020 blind-sighted the entire world. I was shocked that this level of severity was still possible in the 21st century. I came to the USA for ""milk and honey"" not to face a Pandemic.   On the 10th of January 2019, I enrolled in a community college called Georgia Perimeter with a Major in Computer science. Although I hated coding courses and dreaded going to class, I was set to persevere because it was not the career I was after, it was the money. I had a part-time job at Burlington coat factory as a cashier while I was going to school Full-time. I thought everything was going to be just fine.    After the Pandemic, I was furloughed from Burlington, this was the start of an organized disaster in my life. I had to rethink my life deeply and about how I was a Computer Science major just to make money and to also to be an inspiration to my mother. My grand plan had fallen into a billion untraced pieces. I failed many classes to the extent I had to repeat classes. This was not in the plan; I was wasting money. I did not believe in depression until it happened to me. I did not care about anything anymore until a ray of sunshine peeked its head through the cold darkness.   I decided to try something unorthodox, I started my own little Amazon storefront. I was amazed at the success I was having through amazon. I never in a million years thought it would work out. The profits from amazon became a source of income for me. A couple of months after this I authored a book called Fundamental Truths. I was gaining momentum in my time of darkness. It utterly shocked me that people bought the book I wrote. I realized I was so into economics and entrepreneurship. This shift led me to make a huge decision to change my major to Economics/business administration. My love for business and finances manifested. I have never experienced happiness in the form it presents itself today.      I was bonded in chains with unquenched hunger but today I sprouted as a rose. Unexpected disruptions may lead to unforeseen momentum. ",

During my study in University of Benin, Edo State, Nigeria, my father who  was my source of joy, motivation and encouragement was diagnosed with kidney disease. My  mother sacrificed everything she had financially for his treatment to keep him alive because of the  love she had for my dad, and also because she was an orphan and her older siblings had cut ties with  her after she refused to marry who they wanted her to get married to and she refused bluntly. She  stood her ground and married the person she truly loved breaking the custom of forced marriage  which is practiced in some Some parts of Nigeria.  After a long-term battle with kidney disease, I lost my father to the cold hands of death. The  news of my father's death weighed me down while I was pursuing my undergraduate degree  but I made a promise to forever make him proud , be the best in all I do and never give up and  this kept me going till date.   I was very excited to be admitted at Western Illinois University into their Quantitative  Economics program because I had earlier done an extensive research about the university and I  was convinced that it was the right fit for my next academic journey. I found out that the  department of Quantitative Economics offers a perfect mix of theoretical and practical approach  to Economics also, the current research work of Professor Harittma Chauhan aligns perfectly  with my research interest. I also reached out to professors in the department about my interest to  work with them.   Upon reaching the campus and starting classes, I quickly reached out to my graduate advisor to  know what opportunities are available for graduate students. My interaction with him was very  productive. Although, their graduate assistantship opportunities were already filled for the  semester and I was unable to receive one, however I was employed by Corbin-Olson dinning  services where I get to learn, work, and serve students of Western Illinois University.

Despite the fact that my environment changed in the midst of the semester, I did not let this diminish my resolve and drive for achievement. Despite the challenges, I was able to finish the semester with a 3.8. My first obstacle was the adjustment to online instruction and with that came the familiarization to tools like ""Zoom"", which we all have grown accustomed to in both the academic and professional environment. It was really different taking classes via zoom because not everyone has the luxury of having a peaceful workspace, let alone if you have siblings, parents, or even a spouse who were also in a virtual setting. I can't even remember how many times my mom or sister interrupted me during class; all in all trying to find a workplace free of distractions was hard to come by. As a result, it was imperative that I communicated my class schedule with individuals I was living with in order to make sure that I was able to give my undivided attention to my studies. It was also definitely a challenge to attempt to communicate effectively with my professors. We are all so familiar with the difficulties of unreliable wifi and zoom in general, and we all know those occasional wifi issues that either cause your screen to freeze or cut off communication.  Prior to the pandemic, I enjoyed being able to engage with my professors with the use of office hours. With those interactions I was able to not only gain a deeper understanding of the material, which we know can be extremely difficult, but it also allowed me to forge genuine connections. Therefore, while in this virtual environment I have realized just how significant and beneficial the relationships with my professors have had throughout my academic career. Nonetheless, during this time we all discovered new ways to communicate, such as utilizing short zoom calls or an app that allows us to communicate more efficiently and seamlessly in a group setting like Discord. Although there were many ups and downs of Spring and Summer 2020, having to use zoom helped me enhance skills that I did not know I truly needed. In a more casual and less scary situation, I was able to fine-tune my soft skills. I discovered how to nativage virtual classes, interviews, and even presentations. I was able to concentrate on self-improvement in these areas and with those challenges and lessons learned I have seen myself grow both personally and academically.  All and all, while the Spring and Summer 2020 brought its unique and unexpected challenges, now being able to reflect, I am certain that I would not be the person that I am today which is committed to preserving through any challenges that comes my way.

Before I go into a barrier that I faced during the pandemic let me start with background. In 2014 I was diagnosed with Breast cancer. I underwent a double mastectomy and like the warrior that I was born to be I fought and won my battle. Life was good and I was ready to begin a new journey with finish my college education. I enrolled into Medgar Evers college in spring 2020. I flourished in school and finished the semester with a 3.7 despite the obvious covid-19 barrier that many universities faced during this trying time. Everything for me was still going as planned. Well not exactly as planned but we were in a pandemic, so hiccups here and there were expected.  I was set to begin my spring semester but unfortunately fate had other planes for me. On august 16th a week or so before school was set began my cancer came back. Not only had it come back but it moved to the next stage which would require a move serious with getting rid of it this time. To some this may have deterred them starting and finishing the semester, but I refused to let this decease or pandemic beat me. So as planned I moved forward with my semester all while battling this monster. I had another mastectomy on sept 17th and the next day after my surgery I completed exams for two of my classes. I went through radiation treatments in the morning and attended classes in the afternoon. This was one of the hardest things I had to do. during my first ordeal with this deadly disease in 2014 I was constantly surrounded by family and friends. Because of covid -19 no one was allowed in the hospital or my treatment centers with me. On top of feeling isolated from those I loved due to the covid restrictions I was now isolated and sick. At this time depression begin to kick in and my motivation for school and life in general began to decline. I had to dig deep to move forward, or all my hard work would be for nothing. So, I decided to pull myself up and exit the pity party I was throwing myself. I began to focus on all the positives in life despite any hurdles I was facing. I had to remind myself that I was alive and thriving despite my illness. I was doing a disservice to myself and all those walked me during my battle. I didn't give up and it's something I wear as a badge of honor. I use it as motivation that I can do anything with will and positivity. ",

However, this time was also very formative. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to not have to grieve a lost loved one or catch Covid-19 myself. My heart goes out to those who did have to go through those things. This pandemic happened during a pivotal moment in my life. The height of the pandemic happened at the end of my senior year of high school while I was transitioning into the workforce and to college. All of my high school career I had this idea of what this time of my life would look like, but reality took an unfortunate turn. It was hard for me to cope with or fully comprehend the changes that were happening. I never thought in a million years that this time would bring more financial hardship, anxiety, or loss of experience. However, it did, and it was up to me to change my mindset and adapt to the changes around me if I wanted to progress in life and achieve the goals I set for myself. I overcame the challenge of having issues with adapting to my ever-changing environment by focusing on what I could control. For example, I could not control the fact that I had to take online classes, but I could control my performance in the class overall by keeping a close eye on my assignments, staying in contact with my teachers and professors, and using other school resources available to me. I could not control the fact that as a new employee, upset and grief-stricken customers would lash out at me. However, I could control my reaction and choose to defuse the situation by using empathy and patience. I could not change the fact that due to quarantine I could not have normal graduation, a celebration with my friends, or college orientation, however, we did what we could virtually. Finally, I could not change the fact that the financial situation in my household had grown tense. All I could do was go to work and fill out scholarships to ease the financial burden of me going to college.

Furthermore she began to experience complications towards the end of her quarantine which made me feel even worse because I was the only person besides my grandmother that could help her during the time. Moreover, my obstacle came when I had to juggle homelife while also focusing on my academics. However, I found that opening up to faculty as well as having a set schedule where I would be able to chat with my mom was a great helper that allowed me to be able to check in at home and study as well as do  assigned work.

This meant that I had to either leave the country or go back to school in order to maintain an active status in this country, as I am an international student. It was an incredibly difficult time because this was a job, I had worked so hard for. In school I had maintained good grades, and I had attended several networking events and job fairs (such as the Southern Region convention) in order to be considered for a well-paying job upon my graduation. When I found out that I had not been selected for this work visa permit, I applied pursue higher education, as this was something that I had also always wanted to do. I decided to work towards second degree given the circumstances and change my perspective. I went from making some money that could sustain me, and some that I would send to my family back in Zimbabwe, to going back to school without a guaranteed source of income.   I questioned my career choice, and journey because I felt defeated. I could not even afford to pay my own rent, because I was trying to save up some money to pay for my remaining graduate school tuition. During these tough times, a work friend accommodated me for free for the entire year of 2020, as I saved my pennies to be able to enroll in graduate program. During this time, I experienced NABAs motto of lifting others as we climb, which I now also do by helping students in Zimbabwe with the athletic scholarship application process in the United States- since I received a tennis scholarship for my undergraduate program. Now, that I look back, I am thankful for the challenges that came my way. I am thankful because I did not get comfortable in a job and settle. I believe that being uprooted from my job was important because I had to learned how to be entrepreneurial, and constantly invest in educating myself with taking new course and learning new skills.   During this time, I also met my now fiancÃ©. This is something that would have never happened had I continued with the bustling of my previous schedule. We reconnected at a time when we were both out of jobs, and we were encouraging each other, studying new courses together and practicing interviews together.   I look back now, and I am thankful for the challenges that came with the pandemic. However, the pain and losses (losing my grandmother to covid) I still wish I could reverse the hands of time. I think that everything that transpired during the pandemic was to make me stronger and put me on the right path. I believe that my now late grandmother would be proud.  ",

I remember packing up and leaving my business statistics class and preparing for Spring break. I remember my professor encouraging us to stay safe given the Coronavirus that was mainly affecting China. I remember not being too concerned about the Coronavirus outbreak because it was happening ""over there."" In a matter of literally a week, my spring break was extended, and I was getting my degree online. The COVID-19 Pandemic shifted society abruptly. Even more so, the Pandemic drastically changed how education was delivered to students.   The transition to online education was challenging for me to navigate for the majority of the Pandemic. I was a student that thrived best in the classroom setting. I enjoyed going to the classroom listening to my professor lecture while jotting down notes. One of the most significant challenges of remote learning was the lack of social interaction. I missed being able to interact with my professors and fellow students. The shift to remote learning occurred right before taking my accounting intensive courses. I took numerous business classes until this point, but only a handful of those business students were accounting majors. Therefore, when I started to take challenging upper-level accounting courses during the Pandemic, I literally knew no one in my classes. Not knowing anyone in my accounting courses was incredibly difficult because I was used to gathering in small study groups to grasp concepts better. The Pandemic caused me to rethink and reevaluate how I learned quickly. I had to adapt to the new and uncharted environment or face the possibility of failing academically.   I struggled in a few of my classes during the Pandemic. I was dealing with the health, societal, and academic challenges caused by the Pandemic. But one of the main things that got me through the Pandemic was remembering how many people and organizations invested in me through mentorship and financially. I had an obligation to finish no matter how hard or challenging this journey was. I overcame the challenges of going to college in a pandemic by thinking outside the box and utilizing the benefits of technology. For example, I learned to connect with classmates to complete projects and study sessions through WebEx and Microsoft Teams. As we shifted to a more ""normal"" in-person instruction, the challenges of the Pandemic decreased. I could socially connect more with my accounting classmates, and being in the classroom helped me grasp the information better. Ultimately, this Pandemic has taught me that the virtual environment is not going anywhere, whether we like it or not. I have learned to accept and appreciate this new hybrid world we find ourselves in right now. This Pandemic taught me to value completion over perfection in my academic performance. I learned that life is sometimes right out hard, and sometimes all you can do is finish. It might not be the prettiest but finish!     ",Yes

Maxwell. I like this quote because it reflects how I reacted to the disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic for the last two years. I was a freshman in college when Covid-19 had just hit the United States, and this pandemic has taught me how to grow professionally and personally even though there is a big change happening worldwide. During the Covid-19 pandemic, I had learn the ability to manage my time wisely while learning in a new environment that I was not familiar with, it has taught me the importance of consistency when it comes to my work, and taught me some valuable communication skills in a time where social distancing was a happening.  	The first challenge that I had to overcome during the pandemic was to learn how to manage my time wisely. My school had shifted from an in-person environment to a virtual environment from which no one was prepared for. I was put in a situation where I had to figure out how I would learn the materials on my own so I could still pass and maintain a good GPA. It was definitely hard to do, but I had to put in the effort and had to figure out a way to learn a different way and on my own, and to maintain a job outside of school and still keep up with my family during such a time. I had to come up with a schedule and I had stuck with it. Another challenge that I had to overcome was to be consistent with my learning and with my growth personally and professionally. Because the classes had switched to virtual learning, it became more difficult to understand and it took much more time to do schoolwork than usual. I had to be consistent and I had to learn to wake up early to get my work done and that taught me how to have a more efficient day in which I could manage my time to do what was necessary. 	Another challenge that I had to overcome was to learn to communicate and to network with professionals even though every event that was taking place was virtual. I had to learn how to adapt to this new environment and take advantage of technology as it comes to communication. Because of that, I had the opportunity to network with people whom I would have never had the opportunity to because of the physical distance. Over the past two years, I have developed relationships with professionals as mentors for me, even though they do not live in the same state as me.  	So overall, even though the pandemic was very challenging, I had the opportunity to learn a lot of things that are necessary to both my schooling and my professional career. I had the opportunity to meet other professionals and I still had the opportunity to learn new skills and participate in several professional events and conferences.  ",

We didn't go outside, we didn't go shopping for groceries, and even drive-through check-ins were off-limits. We locked ourselves in our house, away from the world, and away from every aspect of life that brought us so much joy.   The majority of our friends didn't believe in covid and were living their normal lives. Meanwhile, our family spent every day anxious that the virus would sneak through the cracks of our home and take away my high-risk parents. So, I remained inside and started to give in to the idea that the only good thing in life was my very frequent naps. I lost the spark and drive that I've had my whole life and felt unmotivated to even get out of bed in the morning. It was as if with the stench of Clorox and hand sanitizer came a dark cloud of depression on our household. My mother stopped smiling, my dad found everything angering, and my brother shut himself into his room like me. A family of extroverts shriveled into nothing in a matter of weeks.   One day after calling my friend from Brazil, who had covid restrictions even worse than me, I realized that I was throwing my life away to these emotions. Despite her restrictions, my friend had continued to remain motivated to support her family. She inspired me to try and bring joy to our household. So I determined a plan, I would do things with my family members that they enjoyed to cheer them up. I started planning things out on my calendar. I talked to each of my family members to find a time where they were available to hang out. I started with my mom who loved playing card games and we quickly went from one day of laughing over our competitiveness to a couple of nights a week playing card games. I tried to support all of my family members. I played video games with my brother and listened to music with my dad. These things became habits that were the sole source of joy in my life. I felt so fulfilled to feel happy with my family again.  There was a significant change after that day. And although it doesn't seem like the most pressing or life-changing hardship, I learned more about myself than ever before. I found the ability to push my emotions to the side and support others. Now, when I experience emotional challenges I often remember how I continued to support my family despite depression. I make a schedule, I write down tasks, I prepare myself just like I did in quarantine. The whole experience brought me this new ability. ",

Before COVID, I worked at EY as a consultant and traveled every week for work. Like every other young professional starting out their career, I wanted to show leadership that I was a top performer and build my brand. I had the energy, appetite, and drive to be the best out of my peers. Work became the center of my life. I worked 50-60 hours a week, completing client deliverables, attending meetings, and managing firm initiatives. My mind was so concentrated on work and my career that I did not have the time to focus on myself.  Suddenly, COVID-19 had arrived and altered the way that many of us live our lives. The lockdowns, school and office closures, and remote meetings took over our daily lives. Instead of visiting the client every week, I was sitting in the bedroom, spending most of my time attending virtual conferences and Skype calls. It prompted me to self-reflect about the past, present, and future as time passed. I began to analyze my purpose, accomplishments, and goals. I was thankful to have a job that allowed me to work from home and remain in good health. I was grateful to still have my family, close friends, and partner with me through this unprecedented moment. However, I recognized that all my achievements came from my career and not personal life. It made me take a closer look into my purpose and what I wanted my life to be in the future.  During this time, I realized how much work was consuming my life, and  I did not get the chance to enjoy the fruits of my labor. With the news of COVID and death, I learned that life is too short, and you must enjoy the moment right now. I discovered that mental health is just as important as physical health. I wanted to travel more often and see what the world had to offer me. I wanted to spend more time with my family, like having dinners, since this should not be taken for granted.

As a student I faced many challenges since I never had an online course and my school switched to all online courses for everyone. Second, I experienced financial hardship. Thirdly, from a family of six and the emotional stress of my family and I catching Covid-19 was very frightening. Listed below are more detailed information about my difficulties having to adjust to the Covid-19 world. As a college student enjoying my sophomore year when all of sudden I heard of a deadly virus name Covid-19 Pandemic. I didn't think much about Covid-19 because I thought it would be here today and gone tomorrow like other challenges I faced in my life. It was suddenly announced that all classes at my college were going online. I had to learn to adjust being at home all day with my family of six and feels like it gets a little crowded in the home. The pandemic had a negative effect on my academics a little since the style of teaching during the pandemic was new to me. The inability to have stable internet was a big problem since I live in an area with poor Internet connection. However, there was so much frustration learning to complete all  assignments online in isolation without our professors to hold a face-to-face conversation was difficult.  Next, I faced financial difficulty securing enough funds to assist me with purchasing a laptop and access codes for my online assignments. This was very difficult since I did not work and do not come from a wealthy family. I did not want to fall behind in my work was frightening to me. However, I was happy that my parents were able to help me and my sister with the technology we needed to keep us from failing our courses and to keep our GPA from dropping. I would not say I have fully overcome the Covid-19 challenges since now have a student loan to pay. Lastly, I had a fear of getting exposed to or coming in contact with someone with Covid-19. Also, the fear that my own family members might be exposed to Covid-19 was scary.  Even when I went to the grocery store, in my mind I would look at others and would think that maybe they have Covid-19. I started having a feeling of distrust for everyone who was a stranger, especially when the CDC said everyone should stay six feet distance from each other.  In summary, Covid-19 negatively impacted me by altering my college classes from face-to-face to completely online, creating financial problems, and I truly giving me a fear of Covid-19 exposure.

I graduated in June of 2020 on a hot summer day at Goose Creek High School football field. It was the first time ever that a class graduated in this particular fashion and it wasn't due to our class being the 50th graduating class but the fact that Covid-19 changed the way we celebrated important events like graduating high school. A lot of peers were frustrated that they weren't able to show out and have the time of their lives during prom or graduate with as much people there as they wanted. Instead, we had to settle for two individuals and a pat on the back for our 12 years of public education. It's challenging having to settle for the minimum when you worked so hard to make your peers, your mentors, and yourself proud. I had to realize the reasoning behind our treatment and it was due to people becoming ill and dying. Covid-19 is no joke and as my peers and I discussed how deadly this virus was, I could see how it was affecting others and their lives.

During the Summer of 2021, I interned remotely for Dell Technologies as a Query and Issue Management. I encountered many issues such as effectively communicating through oral and written communication, relationship building, and working virtually. Interacting with my employees seemed impossible because I wasn't familiar with solely working on a single computer for over 8 hours. Nor was I familiar with communicating with others through a screen. However, my manager and peers encouraged me to utilize the training provided to combat my challenges. Also, as an intern, I am are equipped and encouraged to attend many opportunities such as virtual interactive zoom calls, virtual luncheon events, and games to combat the virtual work environment. Additionally, I create daily check-in calls with my team, other interns, and employees to strengthen my network within Dell Technologies. One concept that I learned from my internship is to be agile and maintain a work-life balance while working remotely for a better outcome.

Graduating from college during a pandemic was extremely difficult for me due to the uncertainties of what path I would subsequently take as a HBCU graduate. Given the new environment, we all had to figure out how to navigate our lives and adapt to the new normal. It was uncertain as to where life would take me as I was in a period of confusion and financial hardships. After all the hard work and sacrifice I made studying in a foreign country away from my family, my hope was to graduate and be rewarded with a job that would help to start my career as a business professional. However, it did not turn out that way because the real world became a lot more real.   	 Post-graduation my housing arrangement was almost non-existent as I was transitioning from living in the university dorms, funded by an athletic scholarship, to having to search for a place to live in one of the most expensive cities in the US, Washington DC. Additionally, the pandemic gave rise to companies laying off employees. Therefore, as a newly graduated international student with the gift of one year to live in the US, I faced the struggle of not even being considered by companies.  At this time, it felt as if my one year to grab the best opportunity and show my worth was running out.  I refused to pack my bags and return home to a third-world country where my newly acquired degree may not be used because of the lack of opportunities back home. However, despite the setbacks, I never gave up because I knew that all my hard work and sacrifice would not go in vain.     The next hurdle of my freshly picked adult life was making timely decisions on what my next plans were. Due to the restrictions placed on me as an international student, it would be even more difficult to find employment like some of my colleagues who were not ""aliens"" of America. As a student-athlete, but specifically a hurdler, I have faced many hurdles but the rigor of deciding my next step would be one of the most challenging hurdles that I had encountered so far. Should I return home and only use my degree as a trophy that I showcase in my bedroom, or should I return to school and pursue my master's degree so that I can become more marketable when the world refocuses? I eventually returned to my alma mater, the University of the District of Columbia, the HBCU underdog that molded me for the past four years. All 'hurdles' considered, I am pleased with my choice as I begin to prepare myself for my final year in the Masters of Business Administration program at the University of the District of Columbia. Although funded by a student loan, a reality I never wanted to face, I will continue to grow through what I go through. ",

As time went on, we were hit with the cold reality that moving forward our lives would never be ""normal"". Personally, I had to overcome the anxiety and fear formed by the sudden halt to all my current and future plans while trying to quickly learn and operate the new world in a virtual realm. As a university student who has never willingly taken an online class, I was forced to quickly learn how to operate in a virtual environment as an effect of the Covid-19 pandemic. For the first few months I truly struggled with this as I had to get used to the notion of logging in to classes instead of simply walking in, making sure that my microphone was on mute so that my background/home noise aren't distracting or interrupting to anyone else instead of just making sure that I'm quiet during a lecture, getting familiar with virtual capabilities to participate within classes instead of just physically raising my hand. Though it was tough for the first few months, I learned to overcome these challenges by being incredibly intentional and homing in on my communication and time management skills.  Thankfully, the skills mentioned above came in handy a little later as well when the Covid-19 pandemic also forced my internships to be virtual experiences. Going forward it seems that the internships will continue to be virtual which truly shows how deep of an impact Covid-19 has had on our society. In conclusion, I had to overcome a few challenges during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic which allowed me to develop and home in on a few necessary skills that have led me to be perform successfully in classes and internships.

It goes without saying that more than most people suffered personal or collective difficulties due to the pandemic. Moreover, worldwide grieving made it more difficult to feel sorry for oneself, and I happened to fall into that category. 	My wonderful uncle, a strong and active person, had been cancer-ridden for many years. He was more motivational and positive about his illness than we, family members, were supposed to be. Soon after the start of the sanctions, protocols, and the aggravated intensity of this widespread disease COVID 19, my amazing uncle passed; it was a huge shock. For years, he had battled cancer in various stages and locations throughout his body. A month after he'd been free of one, another would be discovered. He does, however, frequently visit urgent care, which, as you know, was not the best decision at the time. You didn't want to go to the hospital, but there weren't many choices; his pain and crisis were unbearable. My uncle, however, would not be returning home after another seemingly innocuous hospital visit. This occurred during the pandemic and at the start of my college years. My battles included accepting or figuring out what was true, dealing with change, being productive, being emotionally available for younger siblings, and so on. Regardless of how strong-willed or focused-driven I was, I couldn't deny that it was difficult. Nonetheless, I slowly but steadily got back up and found reasons to keep going, regaining my drive. 	With each passing day, more awful incidents occurred. It was depressing to be online or watch television; the safest place was alone in the dark, isolated from the rest of the world.  	I am highly committed to Nigeria as a Nigerian. During the BLM movements, protests for public safety against dishonest and criminal government officials who murder and loot innocent people for no reason took place in my city. There was a massacre, heartbreaking stories, some of which were close to my family's home. It was difficult to focus on what appeared insignificant at the moment, such as school or my grades. 	Sharing all of this highlights how much anxiety, despair, death-fears, and other negative emotions pervaded my life at the time. You may call it emotional warfare because it included guilt over being better off than others who had lost multiple family members. 	Supremely, I am grateful for the challenges I endured since they served only to showcase my strength and potential for greatness. 		 		 Throughout it all, I was president of my community college's honors society, organized a community event to share the art of dance, earned a scholarship to support my family back home, and earned my associate's degree with a 3.95/4.0 GPA and highest honors. So I encourage everyone to begin the moment that feels like the end.",Yes

The adjustment from in-person to remote learning was difficult. My professors did their best to provide high-quality education during this adjustment, but some subjects suffered more than others. Subjects such as English were not as difficult to learn while remote, but others such as Finance were more challenging. The learning adjustment became even more difficult when my father became ill. My father suffered multiple heart attacks at the start of 2021. We called the ambulance for him twice, and both times the paramedics sent us to hospitals that were far due to others having reached their capacity. The hospitals were full of Covid-19 patients, thus making it difficult to find a place for my dad to be treated.  Before the pandemic, I never had to worry about whether I or anyone I knew could receive treatment for an illness or ailment. I  saw just how many people were affected when we learned that my dad could not be treated at a hospital nearby. My dad was in and out of hospitals, sometimes for weeks at a time, and this impacted me more than I realized at the moment. I was afraid that we would lose him, which caused me to become anxious every time he was admitted to the hospital. The constant anxiety caused me to fail one of the classes that I needed for my major. I felt like I was falling behind on the schedule I created for myself. I had to retake the class over the summer while doing my accounting internship simultaneously and passed it with an A. I had to apply myself more than I did the first time, and it felt amazing to have overcome something so challenging before.  While I was fortunate enough to not have lost someone to COVID-19, the health condition of my dad caused me to see how severe the impact covid had on many other people. Passing a course that I previously failed became the highlight of my year and is an accomplishment that I hold dear to my heart. I believe that everything happens for a reason, and while I had a setback early in 2021, I managed to pass the class with flying colors. Not only did I show others that I had what it took, but I also proved it to myself and was able to appreciate the challenge that may not have happened if not for COVID-19.",Yes

I want to thank him for his covering, grace, mercy, and everlasting love. I want to think him for covering me and my family during this time. Currently, life is fragile and oh so gentle. As I continue to pass through this life, I hope that I continue to learn to speak more thoughtfully and carefully, live with pure intentionality, and impart more thoughts of gratitude in each day. 	If I can be frank, this pandemic has been a pure hell for this country. Life has a way of gut punching you and giving you a strong and stern reminder that we are not in charge. We go through life with a plan, or expectation of how our day to day life should be. As much control as we think we have, we do not, and that is one thing I learned. Having to continue and go through the day to day living in the unknown and fear. Worried about my husband and my mom who were on the front lines working in the nursing homes, having to gear up in hazard suits to combat this deadly disease, all while doing what they could to protect themselves and me. I worried about my family, when I could not exchange a warm embrace or a hug and spend time with whom I loved most.  	I watch CNN daily, with each passing day delivering more somber news coverage than the day before. Seeing people lives being shook to their core by losing jobs, homes, unable to pay their bills, and not able to make ends meet for themselves and for their families. The heartache and aguish that I felt for others who could not even receive decent closure to be with family members during their transition after putting up a fight to this heinous illness, and not even getting a moment to say goodbye.  	With having to process the happenings around me in the world that I live in, I've learned to overcome the barrier of gratitude and surrendering. It's so easy in this life to complain. It's very easy and convenient to resort to all that is wrong. This id easy to do especially when you feel as though the negative outweighs the positive happenings in your life.  I have overcome the act of being more grateful for everything, no matter how miniscule it may be. I am for the most part, healthy and able. There are days sometimes, when I spent down to my last of my paycheck to pay bills, but thankful I still have a job to do so. I express gratitude of not having t face food insecurity, even if that means eating something at home that I may necessarily not be in the mood for. I'm filled with the utmost gratitude to wake up every day for another chance to try again. ",

There was a situation where I was failing my remote learning class, and during this time all I wanted to do was give up. My advisor propelled me to gain strength to complete this class and not drop it. I attended tutoring sessions 4 days out of the week for this class until the end of the semester. At the end of the semester, I ended this class with an A. I learned two major lessons from this experience. The first major lesson I learned from this experience was I can do whatever I put my mind to. The second major lesson was just because something is difficult doesn't mean I can't accomplish it.  Learning that I could do whatever I put my mind to was life changing for me, especially since so many other things were happening due to the pandemic. After this experience there wasn't anything that I thought I couldn't do. If I don't know how to do something, I try to figure it out myself, and if this doesn't work I seek assistance. There is no limit to what I can do. In my opinion everyone should have an experience where they realize they determine their own destiny, then actually putting it into effect. I will continue creating the pathway for the things I want to accomplish.  Not only did I learn I can do whatever I put my mind to from this experience; I also learned just because something is difficult doesn't mean I can't accomplish it. Getting through this class was a hard task for me, but I continued being persistent. Before this experience anything I anticipated was difficult I didn't want to partake in. Having this experience helped me to approach my life in a unique aspect. Oftentimes when something is difficult other people completely give up. However, now I don't know what giving up is. Having the right mindset about what you can accomplish is imperative. We all are here for a purpose, and I am determined to discover what mine is.  To conclude, there is a quote by Jack Welch that says ""Control your own destiny or someone else will."" I experienced this situation with failing my class. I was able to take away major lessons. First lesson being I can achieve whatever I put my mind to. The second lesson was merely because something is critical doesn't mean I can't accomplish it. These two lessons have opened my eyes for my own destiny. I am here to motivate myself and accomplish things in my life without letting the obstacles tear me down. I will constitute the life I cherish for myself, and help others see they have the power to do so as well.

From individuals experiencing severe sickness to families losing relatives in death, there have been many different challenges, and associated barriers, to stand against and overcome.  For myself, a specific challenge that I experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic was concentrated in health and economic insecurity. During the year 2020 of the Covid-19 pandemic, I was diagnosed with viral Pneumonia and, due to its aggressive nature, did not completely heal until 6 months post diagnosis.    Unfortunately, the company I worked for demanded I return to work days after my hospital stay and, even with an abundance of medical documentation, I was given the ultimatum to return to the office or be dismissed.  It is important to note that I was a hybrid working employee, so I worked remotely from home 3 days a week, while working in the office 2 days a week.  In addition, the office environment was not safe for healthy or unhealthy people, as employees were constantly allowed to come to work sick, not wear masks, nor was there social distancing.  Thus, I was already set up to continue working remotely while recuperating and it was not medically safe to work in the office, as no office safety measures were being enforced.  Expectedly, I quit and, although this was going to cause economic strain, there was no real alternative for me to safely stay employed and continue to battle my Pneumonia.  I am blessed to testify that, while healing, my church and family helped my son and I with food, rental assistance, and funding for medical treatment.  Regarding securing another job, I was hired at a more welcoming place of employment during the year 2021 of the Covid-19 pandemic and was able to re-establish my ability to maintain my own household bills and food security for my household.  While at this current place of employment, my health has moved in a sinusoidal wave like pattern with recurrent lung infections from Covid-19 exposure.    However, my current place of employment illustrated just how much they valued my hard work and dedication to my position, while also being a Single-Mother, Full-time Accounting student, where I was still managing to maintain a 4.0 at Rutgers University, and follow my treatment plan, by transitioning my in-office position into a remote at-home position so that I could heal properly and remain employed with the company.  Simultaneously, my son had to be hospitalized for a procedure concerning a cancer scare from extremely low blood cells and being severely immunocompromised, which became a bigger issue due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Gratefully, his condition is benign, my lungs are healthy again, and I can celebrate the victory of an overcomer as I move forward with my personal, academic, and professional journey, albeit with great care during the continuation of this Covid-19 pandemic!

I know in my situation I was constantly worrying about whether the healthcare system in my country would support my parents or my grandparents. I constantly worried about my parents' business, if it would survive the pandemic because Zimbabwe just doesn't have facilities to support small businesses that are in person, what more businesses becoming largely remote? Simple transactions like telegraphic transfer for my tuition couldn't be performed. This burdened me. Being an international student is an emotional rollercoaster. This pandemic highlighted to me that I do not enjoy being so far from home because life is not guaranteed. One thing I struggled with was hearing about the deaths of those close to me. Many lives were lost during the pandemic, and I guess for me the battle I must face is acknowledging that this person who I left at home 6 months ago won't be there when I return. I constantly asked myself if this would be true of my parents or my siblings and if I would be able to process the death of my own blood. Would I be able to grieve alone here and restart this process when I go home, and the actual realities hit me? I had to overcome myself, my old ways of thinking, my feelings, and my biases. I realized that the only thing I could control was my mental health and my grades. Letting go of the ""what ifs"", made me lose a sense of control. I felt like I was in the unknown, I felt so hollow, so lost and so helpless. I mean what could I have done to stop the effects of this pandemic? Daily I took active steps to affirm myself, that one day when the travel ban is lifted, I will go home, and everyone will be alive. I kept saying to myself that ""this too shall pass"", I kept reminding myself that my feelings are not reliable because they change and fluctuate, but good habits will keep my grades high and keep me mentally sane and steady, my discipline held me when I couldn't hold myself together.

I have learnt to accept that my thoughts can be so shallow and can be easily clouded by my feelings. I learnt the importance of goal setting and overcoming.

Baruch College,Treasurer,*Assistant Treasurer,No,,,,Yes,Yes,RBC Capital Markets,Yes,No,RBC Capital Markets,No,,No,,"The Covid-19 pandemic was a difficult time for the world, and it still is as there are still cases going on. It affected us in many ways, but for me specifically, it affected my education, mental health, and motivation. For starters, I graduated high school on YouTube; after four long years of hard work and dedication, I had no prom, no senior trip, and no celebration. I then started my college career on zoom for a year and a half, where I didn't get the privilege to connect with my peers and faculty to the max. Learning was very difficult in a virtual environment; everything was so disconnected. Being in a virtual environment also affected me psychologically, to the point where I couldn't even eat and lost most of my motivation. On top of that, I also lost my grandmother, which was the icing on the cake for me.   Nevertheless, I still kept my head up and continued with what I had to do. I took advantage of my counselors to reflect on my mental health and kept it pushing. I joined multiple extracurriculars, like the Urban Male Leadership Academy (UMLA), America Needs You (ANY), and the Baruch Chapter NABA executive board as the assistant treasurer. I also volunteered to facilitate multiple virtual events at Baruch, like the SEEK awards and UMLA 10-year anniversary. All while also applying to internship opportunities and joining insight events for many firms across the finance industry. My mental health got affected by the pandemic because I was inside my room for most of the time. Unfortunately, my living space isn't that big, so all I had was my bed to resort to. I was also under extreme grief after my grandmother died, all while having to take online classes and be locked in my room for most of the pandemic.   Becoming ""comfortable with the uncomfortable"" has been my motto for the past two years; regardless of the circumstances, putting myself out there and getting involved will never do me wrong. By becoming comfortable with the uncomfortable, I overcame the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. By keeping my head up and seeing the bigger picture is how I overcame the Covid-19 pandemic. But ultimately, by believing in myself is how I overcame the pandemic. Believing in myself and seeing the bigger picture is how I secured an internship this summer within an Investment Bank, by believing in myself is how I became a member of the Baruch Chapter Executive board.

This infectious respiratory disease has resulted in a global crisis. Dramatic loss of human life, changes in the education system, border closures, lockdowns, significant job loss, and economic disruptions are just a few examples of challenges faced worldwide by the pandemic as it continues to evolve through phases/variants.  Mass vaccination measures have been deployed worldwide to help curb the pandemic. I personally believe that this has helped. However, the efforts from society vary. Personally, it is disheartening to see how many people believe that this virus is a hoax despite the statistics. I have had family members and acquaintances refuse to abide by the regulations put in place for our own safety; quite frustrating, I must say. Due to such ignorance, I am fearful, and I try my utmost best to have limited contact with individuals and social groups. One major challenge that I have encountered due to the pandemic is the mandatory action of wearing face masks. Initially, such regulation was much more personal for me as I am an asthmatic. The constant wearing of the face mask took a toll on me as I started experiencing frequent asthmatic episodes. I had to be in and out of emergency rooms seeking treatment for the constant 'flare-ups,' which then led to regular anxiety attacks. My automatic rhythm of breathing was interrupted as a result of wearing face masks for long periods, and I usually felt stifled. For instance, on three different occasions, I visited the health facility, and the doctors, as well as nurses, were amazed to see me back so soon, as it was three visits in twelve days. They always try their best to facilitate me in an already strained health care system where their workload has increased, they are working with fewer resources and not forgetting that hospitals are short-staffed. Additionally, I have adapted to virtual/online learning, and my only concern is resuming face-to-face classes where I will have no choice but to wear face masks for more extended periods. Although I fully understand that face masks are an essential tool that acts as a form of protection against the vicious respiratory disease, that doesn't keep me from praying that this pandemic comes to an end soon. Despite the odds, I am overcoming this challenge by trying different types of face masks, taking medication as prescribed to keep my asthma under control, staying indoors as much as possible, doing remote jobs. When I do venture outdoors, it is swift, and all COVID-19 protocols are followed. I know most will agree when I say this is a terrifying time in history"". The future is unknown. The hysteria created has done both good and bad, and all I can do is remain hopeful and grateful for life while coping and seeking the positives in this situation. ",

The switch from regular in-person classes to virtual was definitely one of the biggest challenges of my academic career. I was very nervous finishing up my freshman year and nervous for what my sophomore year would look like. Barriers the virtual platform created include limited access to support on assignments, limited access to professors, lack of energy, minimal teaching effort at times on behalf of professors, and poor networking. These are just a few of the barriers that had impacted my success but, I must say, with grit and perseverance, one can do it all. Being organized and proactive was key for me during the time we were prohibited from in-person classes. If I knew assignments were due on a specific date, I would start them early just in case I needed to ask the professor any questions or get the help I needed. To combat lack of drive and initiative, I made it a mission to leave my on-campus dorm and go to the library or nearby coffee shop to get homework and studying done. This change of environment helped me in times when I was fatigued or lacked motivation. I am grateful for my recognition of my own habits because I was able to curve these habits to my benefit and success during this challenging time. I was also able to complete a research project during this time focusing on the effects of the pandemic on the Black Indianapolis community. I interviewed two African American women and got their vantage points on how they were being affected by the pandemic. One woman had a nonprofit organization and was not able to freely act with the intent to help the community due to the restrictions the government placed on all businesses. Another woman was of age and had been taking care of her elderly mother so her mental health had been affected significantly due to fear of catching the virus and passing it on to her elderly mother. Others lost their homes, jobs, and even had to close the doors of their businesses. We were able to gather from the research all of the issues relevant in today's society affecting Black people and that the pandemic had just glorified the issues at a much larger scale. As a young Black man pursuing a degree here at a PWI, I can attest that it has not been the easiest especially attending the Kelley School of Business. However, again, somehow I believe that if one can find their strength, grit and determination within themselves, they can weather the storm like I did during unfortunate circumstances like the COVID-19 epidemic.",Yes

The world became something many of us could not recognize, mainly because this virus disrupted many individuals' lives. When the virus became more known in the U.S., my school closed its doors to protect its students. Little did I know that the last day as a high school student would have been my 11th-grade year. Due to this pandemic, I missed out on all the essential things many students looked forward to as they got close to graduating. There was no prom for me, no senior skip day, senior class day, etc.  I spent my entire senior year working at my job at Waffle House to save up for college since my mother, a teacher, lost her second job working at the Pilot gas station. Due to the pandemic, the amount of money I was making as a waitress dropped significantly. Today, a moment that still stays in my mind would happen to be when I worked a seven-hour shift and only made fourteen dollars in tips. Since I was relying on the money to help me through college, of course, I was hurt. Following that event, my job was closed for nearly three weeks due to the pandemic. That is how I knew how severe the Covid-19 pandemic was. That was the first time I had ever witnessed the closing of Waffle House. Since I'd started working there, I'd worked every holiday, including Christmas, because they never close. The two and a half weeks home from work were devastating for me. The thought of how I would afford college constantly haunted me. Going out and finding another job was not an option because multiple businesses around me were temporarily closed. Relying on my mother for financial assistance was not an option either, as, during this time, she was desperately looking for a new place for us to live. During this period, I felt like I was at my lowest.  Until I decided to make a risky decision and use the money, I saved up to buy my camera. Photography has always been a passion; however, due to me working all the time, I never was free enough to focus on it. After buying my camera and getting more familiar with operating it, I took pictures of the students. It became a second source of income for me, and my work began to spread on the internet. As more people came to me for pictures, I decided to go ahead and get my business license and make a business page. Although Covid-19 was a struggle for me initially, I overcame my difficulties and pursued a dream I have always had. I view this pandemic as a blessing in disguise because I could force myself out of my comfort zone and try something new due to all the struggles I had to face. ",

It was a frightening time because no one knew what was going on or how severe it was going to get. All people knew was that it was spreading rapidly and that everyone on campus needed to go home. On-campus residents, such as myself at the time, had to leave quickly without cleaning our rooms out properly and we were transferred to remote learning. This was a crazy adjustment for me because during my freshman year I was always out and about.  Therefore, when I was forced to be indoors in my house all the time, not seeing people, only leaving the house for essentials, it was a dramatic shift in the habits I was accustomed to. Thankfully, I did not find remote learning difficult because I always kept a planner with my assignment and quiz dates to ensure I was on track and doing everything I needed to. I liked waking up later to roll over and turn on my laptop to join a class. It was easier and more convenient. However, it did not take long for my liking of the circumstances to turn.  It felt like everything I was doing on campus was a distraction from dealing with my emotions and my depression. When those distractions got taken away, I was saddened and was left to deal with my emotions and thoughts constantly. It was driving me crazy. I am not used to feeling and thinking through my emotions. Doing that sounds like a normal thing to do, but I did not grow up in a household where mental/emotional health was talked about. My parents are Jamaican and in Jamaica, like with black Americans, mental health is not talked about a lot and sometimes not taken seriously. When I go through problems with my emotional state normally, I would feel what I'm feeling for a bit then stuff those emotions in a metaphorical box that I would not deal with because my philosophy was that ""life moves on and does not wait for no one"". With that philosophy, I did not take as much time as I should have to think through and process how I was feeling. I was depressed because of this and feeling trapped in the 4 walls of my room was not helping.  I did not get over this challenge quickly. Honestly, it took me about a year to be okay again. I had to try to be comfortable being uncomfortable when dealing with and processing my emotions. During my year of self-help I exercised, I spoke to a therapist for 6 weeks, and I had to learn to accept and love myself. I am not all the way there yet, but I am taking steps every day to get to where I am trying to be. ",Yes

When the Pandemic started, I was working at a local credit union, sharing the responsibility of caring for my maternal grandfather, and preparing to start full time at CSU Eastbay in the Fall of 2020. However, a few months into the pandemic I lost my grandma suddenly from heart failure. As a result, I dropped my class in the fall of 2020 and quit my job to help take care of my paternal grandfather, as he was devastated. They had been married almost 50 years. After a period of mourning and adjustment I re-enrolled in school in spring 2021. Life was slightly manageable again. After completing the spring semester, my other Grandpa on my mother's side passed from dementia in august 2021. His passing shattered me because I had been taking care of my grandpa since 2017, splitting his full-time care needs with my mother. Navigating through my pain, I completed My Fall 2021 semester and am pushing towards graduation every day, every semester. Through the pain and obstacles, I've faced these last two years, I've learned accolades and accomplishments are pieces of a fulfilling life but being able to support and care for family adds an indescribable level of satisfaction.    Getting into Cal State East Bay in 2020 was a truly life changing moment for me. Finally, I was on the path to reaching my career goals of becoming a CPA by 2022. From grade school until the present, math and all the variety it encompasses has been my academic sweet spot. As an Accounting major, my coursework has been the perfect academic background to launch me into my chosen career. From my first semester at CSUEB, in Intro to Financial Management, I knew I was in the right place to receive the kind of education that would change my life for the better. The work of Accountancy is how I will effectively alleviate human suffering in my community and beyond. As the great great granddaughter of former slaves, the granddaughter of those who lived under Jim Crow, and the daughter of a woman who saw education as her way out of poverty, I am acutely aware of how financial education and a poverty mindset has damaged my community. As a CPA, part of my work will be dedicated to increasing financial literacy amongst the Black community. I strive to increase sound financial decision making, using education as a path to higher income and additional tools in decreasing the wealth gap in this country. Therefore, receiving this scholarship will not only give me an opportunity to focus on giving it my all to my education and alleviate financial stressors, but also will serve as CSUEB's investment in my future and what future me will do for my community.",

I have raised my kids to be kindhearted, loving, and empathetic to others; so, the constant research on the matter was bringing them sadness. I had to find ways to keep them active without leaving home. This was a disruption of our normal equilibrium.

My children motivate me to strive for excellence; I want them to have someone to look up to and be proud of.

My professor was amazing though and he pushed me to keep going. He pushed me to follow through and keep trying. But I gave up. 	Yes, I gave up. I passed all my other classes except intermediate accounting. I quit, threw in the towel, waved the white flag. However, you want to describe it. I was down. I was defeated. And that's what COVID-19 did to me. The sickness, despair and fear made me so overwhelmedâ€¦I quit.  	All-in-all, though, I learned. 	I learned that the madness of life will NEVER end. The only thing I can do is push forward. Now, I see life's struggles as a valley to walk through instead of a desert to lay in. I will never allow myself to quit. And I haven't since. That same professor (Joseph O.) is my advisor. We speak daily and he checks on me when he thinks I need it. I also do the same for him.  	I have been accepted into a MAcc program and will be graduating in 2023. I am excited. I am grateful. That's another thing COVID taught me, to be grateful of every opportunity, because you never know when YOUR books getting checked out the library.  	Overall, In COVID I had to overcome accepting failure, pushing myself to refuse to win, actually catching the virus (I lost my sense of smell), and navigating life during a pandemic. I think I did wellâ€¦because I didn't give up. Instead, I chose to prosper.  ",Yes

",At Large,None,N/A,No,,,,No,No,,,,,Yes,Microsoft- Seattle,No,,"Like many of us during the pandemic, I found myself spending hours on Zoom for classes and work. And while the ability to see other people was a gift during a socially deprived season, it wasn't the best feeling for a 21-year old black girl who grew up avoiding the mirror. I was that one friend who was always taking her friends' pictures just so she won't have to be in the pictures. The feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing were deeply entrenched in my personality and were easily traceable to my childhood. I was the only dark-skinned girl in a family of twelve cousins and the only black girl in middle school. The rejection from people in my own community as a dark-skinned girl had a strong profound effect on my confidence, it had a big influence on how I saw myself.   Being on Zoom, I often found myself turning my camera off and blaming a staggering connection when truthfully I was just trying to stay away from having to look at myself. During exams and interviews which require me to have my camera on, I found myself hyper-aware of the flaws on my skin so I would overly use ring lights and high beam lights around me. I had always been convinced light-skinned individuals are more beautiful and more valued than us dark-skinned girls. As a way to mask the self-hate I was developing, I started burying myself in books at a very young age. I grew up academically motivated, a valedictorian in high school, and earned a full-ride scholarship to college.   However, I was occupied with commitments in college so I never really had the time to reflect on my inner well-being until the pandemic hit and I noticed how much of a significant effect the negative sense of self-loathing had on my character. I had even received an email from one of my professors concerned about my class participation over Zoom since I would always have my camera off. I knew I wasn't the only one struggling with worthlessness but going to a PWI, I didn't know who to reach out to when I hit rock bottom.   I found myself joining a FB group of dark-skinned women who were openly sharing their experiences with colorism. I couldn't fathom the hundreds of stories I read on the group and how as a result of this ill-minded favoritism, our opportunity for success and mental health is very well determined and impacted by the dark complexion of our skin. I felt a genuine connection with the women who were sharing their experiences and in fact, I met a few of them over a meet&greet. I developed relationships with some of the strongest women who to this day are my mentors. With their consistent guidance, I have been going to therapy for over a year now and continue to be part of the group which has been my safe space to share my experiences and work on this well-needed self-love journey.

The classroom is the center of communication where students can converse with themselves and teachers. The elimination of the classroom forced teachers and students  to have to try to create a pseudo-classroom to try to make up for the physical community that was diminished due to its absence.  Covid-19 was not a planned-out event for anyone that I know, and adjustments had to be made, quickly and with prudence. Covid-19, personally, made the use of computer communications more prevalent than ever and the intentional communication between students more important.  	A prime example of the no-classroom dilemma was the communications class that I had to take during the spring of that year. In a class of this sort, face-to-face interaction is the most ideal. In this class, we had to form a group, in which we worked on a project for the duration of the class. We were too far away to meet up with each other, so we had to find a way to communicate outside of that.  We ended up having a group text, but real-time communication brought another dimension to the problem. At school, we as students could communicate freely at a set time, but due to the pandemic, people had different schedules, some of which ran through the time of the regular class period. Negotiating on times in which we could actually simultaneously work together was integral to the success of the class: PowerPoints, meeting documents, etc..: they all had to be completed in unison so that the work would come out as coherent and whole. 	Another example of a barrier of the absence of the classroom during the pandemic was the lessened accessibility to the teacher. For example, in the Economics class that I took, there were questions that I had during the pre-recorded lecture. In a classroom setting, I could raise my hand during the lecture and the teacher could stop and answer my question while the topic was fresh on my mind. In this setting, I would have to email my teacher after the lecture was totally finished and come back to my notes to find where I had the question. It worked, but it was not the most ideal. The connection was there between the teacher and the student, but it was just not as strong and immediate without the classroom.  	In conclusion, the Covid-19 pandemic brought a tough classroom obstacle I that had to overcome. From not being able to talk directly to the teacher and students, to differing schedules, the lack of the classroom had its unique challenges. Through increased innovation in group chats and planning, the problem was alleviated. From the onset of Covid-19 , the traditional form of being a student, personally, had to be amended to fit the guidelines and limitations of not having a classroom or rigid schedule, in a prompt and efficient manner.

These experiences have taught me what endurance truly is and how to see the sliver-lining. Having support and community is something I have a heightened appreciation for now. In this way, the pandemic has additionally shaped my career in accounting. Being a virtual student for the 2020-2021 academic year meant my recruiting experience was exclusively online interactions. Platforms such as Google Meet, HireVue, and Zoom allowed me to network with firms and offices across the country. A common theme when I engaged with these public accounting firms was that the industry is changing. Most firms spoke of already having the infrastructure in place to make the work-from-home transition easier. When I accepted a Crowe busy-season internship this winter, I interviewed, onboarded, and received the equipment in less than 60 days. This seamless process stood out to me as one of the many ways technology is changing the industry. On my internship, my team members and I worked from Nashville, Washington D.C., and even India.

As a world we were confused and afraid. We were unsure of the implications of the deadly Covid-19 virus. So, naturally we panicked, which lead to us making quick decisions to keep us safe. I remember schools in the United States had rushed to fully online classes by March 2020. It was not the best option for students who prefer the face-to-face experience. Like myself, I was dumbfounded that I had to basically teach myself six courses. Additionally, the more traditional lecturers were not prepared to deliver online instructions, therefore student's final grade reflected whatever grade they had worked for by mid-semester. As an international student I became displaced because flights were being canceled all around the world, I was unable to go back home. Covid-19 had a significant impact on the aviation industry. Which lead to a decrease in air travel. Additionally, the tourism industry was affected and since there were stay at home orders local transportation such as taxi services were impacted negatively. Some businesses especial retail stores had to close their markets for a while or totally go out of business as a result of being unable to meet their expenses. As society became more familiar with the Covid-`19 pandemic businesses and travel reopened but with certain precautionary health measures. At that time, I was able to go home, however the trip home was more costly than ever before. During my time home I had to decide on whether I should return to the United States to continue my education. I had a plan B of course which involved working and studying to attain my ACCA back home.

Some of the challenges that it presented for me were that after only one (and a half) semesters of being on campus at college, I had to go back home and spend the remaining and the subsequent semesters at home. Not only did I have to spend the semester at home, but I also could not see most of my friends and family as I had to adhere to social distancing practices. This is a challenge that I am sure is familiar to most of us as our lifestyles completely changed from attending everything in-person to attending everything virtually. Though I was presented with these challenges, my positive mindset helped me turn a troubling situation into a productive one. I looked on the bright side of things; this gave me more time to spend with my family, more time to read, and more time to work on improving myself. This is exactly what I did during the lockdown period and although this was a terrible thing to happen to the world, I am grateful for the opportunity for me to spend more time with my family and to be able to take care of them as I would not have had the chance otherwise.  	The impact that I want on the world is to accomplish my goal of closing the racial wealth gap in America and teaching African-Americans about financial literacy. I also want my family and others to use my life as an example; with hard work and consistency, anything is possible. I want to use my work ethic and my drive for learning to be the fuel to reaching my goals and for other people to use that as inspiration for their own ideas and goals.

This is how I ""climb"" up every day, by working my hardest and always being open to talk to others, and learning ways that I can achieve what I want to achieve. I think that the lifting part of the motto is just as important as the climbing because helping others along the way just as NABA does with its members is something that I want to be able to do on my journey as well.

Georgia Southern University reached out to their student in April 2020 to inform us that the campus would be shutting down and classes would continue in an online format. In addition to campus shutting down, so did on-campus jobs. At that moment,  I was devastated, knowing that I would have to find a new job immediately. As a student who lived off-campus, I would still have to pay rent for the remainder of the year. Statesboro is a  small town that doesn't have many job opportunities, so I had no choice but to return home to find a new job. As a person who knows my ability to perform and get things done, it did not take long to find a new job. I can say that I was in no way prepared to be a full-time college student and work a full-time job. For the first time in my life, I failed a class, Finance to be exact, a class that I enjoyed before the transition. During the Summer 2020 semester, I decided to withdraw from my term B class due to simply being extremely overwhelmed. I took this time to learn what would work for me academically in the future. The first step I took was understanding that this was a change for everyone, and there is nothing anyone could do about the situation. Secondly, I took the time to understand the online formats for each class and figure out how much time I would need to learn the material. Thirdly, I began to plan and use my time wisely. I filled my calendar with all my assignments and set reminders, and I created a schedule for my school work and changed my work schedule based on my school schedule. Finally, I used my classmates and those around me for support if I needed it. Due to these changes, The following Fall semester, I  maintained my full-time classes and the full-time job and ended the semester with a 3.57 GPA making me eligible for Dean's list recognition. I did not understand what was going on, but I later found out this experience prepared me for my future. Beginning spring 2021, I started Interning with a public accounting firm during the busy season, of course. I was not expecting to do an internship, and I had no intentions of taking the semester off from school, although it is a suggestion. At this point, I knew I could work and go to school, so that's what I did.

At the beginning of 2020, Covid-19 became an unexpected hurdle in the lives of many. There were new guidelines and restrictions imposed across the United States and the world to restrict the spread of the virus. With so many unknowns and contradicting research, it was quite difficult for everyone to maintain life as we knew it. Limiting physical contact forced institutions to emphasize the need to work remotely or be laid off. With such an abrupt change, many people as well as students were left scrambling to adapt to the restrictions and changes brought about by the pandemic. It was undoubtedly hard for everyone, but in my opinion twice as hard for an international student. Throughout the pandemic, maintaining proper immigration status, changes to course work, attendance, and delivery were some challenges I had to overcome. Critical decisions had to be made in a short space of time and I became overwhelmed with anxiety, panic, and mental distress. Halfway into the Spring 2020 semester, students were notified of a one-week deadline to vacate the dormitory. I had limited options and no budget for unanticipated moving cost to relocate within the United States. Moreover, the strict guidelines for international students on F-1 visas seemed to be changing every day. It was a nightmare. I would finalize plans on my next move and would need to alter it or reconvene to ensure that I was following the updated changes. Nonetheless, communication with loved ones was heart breaking since everyone faced their own challenges. I eventually had to return to my home country. Then there was the fear of not being able to return to the United States to complete my degree. This alone was quite troubling, knowing how hard I worked thus far. Online learning posed technical issues as well as challenges with professors who struggle to adapt to the new environment as quickly as others. At the beginning, students were forced to learn the course material on their own. By Fall 2020, students were able to return to campus but with no significant changes. Even though some classes were listed as in person or hybrid, they were fully online. This became another personal challenge since I favor being in a physical class setting. Not being able to ask questions or take advantage of one-on-one time with professors made the completion of core course work more strenuous. It is apparent that impacts of Covid-19 will be long lasting and adapting to the changes became a necessity. The challenges I encountered and prevailed over will serve as a learning experience. It strengthened my decision-making skills, allowing me to be more confident in assessing situations to make well informed decisions. The importance of being able to adapt and become more agile was amplified throughout this entire situation. My determination to achieve my educational goals amid a pandemic taught me to not shy away from uncomfortable situations.   ",Yes

My classes were via Zoom, organizations canceled events, and meeting new people in a new city was very difficult. In high school, I found it easy to form relationships with professors and peers. This proved to be a challenge with online learning. I was not prepared to be on Zoom calls with 200 other students. With cameras and microphones turned off, I did not know how to navigate my classes in a meaningful way. The unfamiliarity of college-level remote learning and the isolation I felt from my other classmates led to the battle of imposter syndrome. Unlike a physical battle one may face, it was purely mental, and without being able to see what the issue was, each day became a constant battle of me vs. me. I quickly began to see the effects on my grades and preexisting relationships. I did not know much about navigating college amid a pandemic, but I did know that the only way to do so would require a lot of effort on my end.  My freshman year opened my eyes to some misconceptions I had about myself and my college career. While I was at UT as a student, I realized that I was not on Earth to be one. When I received that revelation, combatting imposter syndrome became a less daunting task. I challenged myself to analyze how it appeared in my life, including fear of failure. I began to consider what it would look like if I did fail -- what the worst possible outcome would be if I did not do well on an exam or in a class. I asked myself the question, ""If I do not get an A, will I die?"" It seems like a silly question to ask, but the truth is, before I asked myself aloud, I thought that I actually might.  My mindset shifted from that point. Firstly, I began viewing failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. Secondly, I no longer viewed college and my potential career as my purpose in life but rather an aspect that plays a part in the bigger picture. When I separated my identity as a human being from my identity as a college student, I realized that I belonged at this school because of the simple fact that I was already here. As I gained more confidence, I was no longer afraid to use the raise my hand feature on Zoom, email a professor with 500 students or initiate study groups with people that I would never meet in person. I could take a more active approach in being a student because I knew I was qualified to be one. Covid-19 has amplified preexisting obstacles in various ways. Though facing a trial is never an enjoyable experience, overcoming it has given me the courage to face others that may come my way.   ",Yes

One of the biggest challenges during COVID-19 is managing classes remotely while dealing with depression and with High-Functioning Autism.   During the 2020 shutdown, classes were from in-person to virtual quickly. I had a rough time focusing and learning in that format. I have moved back to Houston with family due to me being laid-off from my job, as well as having a support team there. My university and professors had to quickly adapt to online classes to continue with the course. It was not an easy time for me during that period. In fact, it quickly got depressing.  My classes were not getting any easier at all. I have assignments, papers, and exams online that I must manage. I was depressed because of changes happening quickly, and the fact that the shutdown has affected my social life completely. Another thing was dealing with a brand-new job situation at Houston working in retail, leading to more stress added for me. Studying for classes with these number of stressors is hard on top with depression in each moment.   Studying online during that point is difficult because my classes were not asynchronous. All my classes were synchronous, leading to class times that were not compatible with my new work schedule. Not being able to see my friends during the shutdown is hard and depressing. I am grateful in April that I have moved back to my hometown; seeing family and at least have sense of social interaction. My grades were dropping due to the stress of learning online, family obligations, work obligations, and social depression because of COVID-19.   With that said, I did overcome the situation of managing classes remotely while dealing with depression by being more social, having enjoyable time management, and by taking my basic level classes at a community college online while enrolled at Texas State. For time management, I have made a schedule of the things that need, as well as listing which classes are asynchronous or synchronous. With work, I have kept consistent communication with my managers and to make sure that I can work more specific hours. Additionally, I have enrolled in my general education classes at Lone Star College online so I can accelerate my completion. That has helped me finish my core level classes and helped me catch up with my course credits. With my social life, I have still maintained my relationships with my friends via in-person, virtual, and a hybrid model. I have been available for people that I really care about.   These things I have done has made me stronger, and more adaptable to uncontrollable events, such as COVID-19. I have done much better in my classes, my relationships, time management, and my course load by trying out different things and appropriately adapting it to the maximum benefit.

At the start of the pandemic, I was in Grand Rapids for an Academic Games State Tournament; it was my seventh and final year that I would be competing at the tournament. Unfortunately, the tournament was canceled on the second day. When I came back from Grand Rapids, everything changed. Our classes went online, and all senior events were either canceled or held virtual. Many of my family members told me about their great experiences at MSU; I yearned for that experience. Unfortunately, I did not get the same opportunity. The pandemic forced me to grow fast. I knew I had to do good in all my freshman classes if I wanted to achieve the same success they did. Thankfully, I was able to excel in my classes, network with Fortune 500 Companies, and meet new friends. I was elected SCREP Chair my first year in NABA and received an internship at Deloitte. I did not let the pandemic stop my success; I knew my future was bright. The summer after my freshman year was hectic. In addition to the internship, I also served as a Conference Assistant for the MSU Summer Business Institute. At the same time, searching for an apartment because I was finally going to live on campus in the Fall. Unfortunately, my brother got Covid-19 and everything in the household changed. I had to focus on taking care of him and the house while doing my internship. Thankfully, I was able to manage everything during the two months it took for him to recover. Then, one month before school started, my sister also got Covid-19. She had to stay with us for a few weeks, which meant I had to take care of her and the house again while getting everything together for my apartment. I am so grateful that I was able to keep myself safe and healthy. Unfortunately, I have had many other family members that got Covid-19. Sadly, some of them passed away. I learned the importance of taking care of my body and my family. More importantly, I realized that I needed to rethink my life choices; how I conduct myself, my emotions, and my feelings. I need to make sure that I am doing the best that I can; physically, mentally, financially, emotionally, and spiritually. These past two years have been tragic, we have experienced so much loss. Time with loved ones should never be taken for granted. It is important to call your loved ones every day, to let go of grudges because, in the end, you will regret that you never resolved them. We must be honest, open-minded, and respectful towards one another because you may never know what the other person has gone through or what they are currently going through today.",Yes

I believe one of the most important issues is Covid-19 pandemic. When talking about, Covid-19 it has impacted multiple people's lives, especially when it comes to learning and technology - new education techniques and greater reliance on technology. Challenges and barriers that I have had to overcome related to the Covid-19 pandemic are learning and technology.  Learning is an essential part of everyday life. It is the process behind acquiring a new understanding when it comes to values, behaviors, skills and a plethora of other attributes. Technology is the sum of skills, methods, and processes used in a single production for the benefits of goods and services accomplished. Learning and technology have not only transformed the everyday life of individuals but it has also created a circumstance that without these attributes, you are set up for failure.  Personally, as I continue to progress in my college career from an undergraduate to a graduate student, I have continued to change my learning style when it comes to passing exams and other assessments needed to test my skills and knowledge. Whether that be studying by myself or learning new topics through a virtual setting, I have constantly readjusted my study habits. Instead of in-person education, I experienced remote learning for two years of my undergraduate course work. During that time, I was also adjusted to taking all assessments online including quizzes, exams, and projects. Throughout the pandemic, my other challenge was technology. I have continued to enhance my digital upskill with Excel and other accounting and finance software, while adapting to Zoom meetings. Although in the beginning, it was extremely challenging learning how to study and use different technology skills, I had to ultimately understand it was the new way of life. In order to stay ahead of the issues related to learning and technology, one must study in new ways and learn new technological skills and software each day to become an expert at it. These skill sets give one an upper hand not only in the industry but in life. I have embodied NABA's motto when it comes to learning and cherishing the programs that the professional chapter provides annually, as well as helping or tutoring others regarding issues that may impact the learning and technology world today. I have had the distinct pleasure of being the President of NABA's West Chester Chapter, and currently the graduate student advisor. NABA's professional chapters have allowed me to learn how to keep up with technology changes within the accounting and finance industry and implement them in my daily learning. I have also learned to give back to others by teaching them what I learned and helping them grow in confidence in the business world and in life. This is a perfect example of implementing NABA's motto ""Lifting as we climb"". ",Yes

At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was in my 2nd semester of college & there became a sudden shift in direction. I remembered clearly,  I was on Spring Break in March when my campus sent out a mass email to all students stating not to return to campus until further notice. After spring break was over, all my classes went straight online. Learning online became the biggest challenge and barrier I experienced during the pandemic. For the past 18years of my life, I had In-person experiences/learning, so going online all of a sudden was difficult for me. The challenges range from staying focused while studying at home to a lack of internet access and reliable devices. The move to digital learning was filled with challenges, and luckily, unexpected times call for creative problem solving to overcome the challenge/barrier.  Going from a structured day on campus to a completely unstructured one at home was difficult to adjust to. Getting into Zoom for lecture classes was the hardest to get into with the distraction of my phone, laptop, people, and social media in the same room. Regardless of the difficulty, I overcame this challenge by implementing a routine and creating a school space area in a room. Sticking to a routine helped me use my time more wisely & I was able to complete my assignment on time. I made sure my routine sticks as closely to my pre-pandemic schedule as possible. I woke up bright early and got dressed, logged on to BlackBoard, and hopped on Zoom. Another way I overcame this challenge was by turning my camera on, taking notes, and participating. These three steps helped me greatly as I saw improvement in my online learning gradually. Another challenge being online during the pandemic was it affected my GPA as I didn't receive a good grade in some classes. I know I would have done even better if the class were in-person as I did before COVID. At the end of the first semester online, my GPA was 3.75, after implementing the ideal solutions listed above, I earned a 3.84 GPA the following semester, and my last semester online (not knowing), I went harder and pushed myself for more. Thankfully, I ended up with a perfect GPA of 4.0 out of 4.0! Covid had its challenges, but with great zeal and a positive mindset, one can overcome it all. ",

Since it happened it has opened my eyes and made me aware of the fact that I should not take anything in life for granted. The pandemic has affected my life in many ways, but in spite of it all, I had to overcome my challenges. One challenge that I had to face was my biggest fare of attending college. I had a fear of going to college because at the age of 15 I had to stop attending school. After losing my mother at such an early age, I was forced to work to take care of my siblings. While taking on this responsibility, I always dreamt of going to college to become an accountant. After immigrating to the United States, I managed to gain my GED Certificate and upon receiving it, I immediately enrolled in Medgar Evers College at the age of 54. After being out of school for so many years, I was very intimidated to go to college. My first semester was Spring 2020, and this was when the Covid-19 pandemic started, forcing me to attend school virtually. This caused my fear of attending college to intensify.  Although it might appear to be an easy task to do online classes and virtual work, doing so was a challenge in many aspects. I experienced uncertainty and doubt about getting the work done, fear, inadequacy, intimidation, and I felt that my language barrier would lead to a lack of communication. I was required to take a readiness test to see if I was ready for virtual learning and the results showed that I was an in-person learner. This increased my fears, but I know that I had to do something to get through this difficult time because I had no intentions of putting off a dream that I had for so long. Also, as a cancer survivor, I was terrified to leave my home or to let anyone into my home, so I had to plan how I would get through this period and over this fear.  To remain focus and help myself get over the fear, I reached out for help on how to navigate Blackboard for class meetings and meetings with the professors. I made a schedule and kept records of where, when and what platforms my professors were using to conduct their classes, and I met with all my professors during their office hours to get the help that I needed to succeed in their classes. I did my job-related work during the day and spent most of my nights making sure that I finish and post my schoolwork on time. Presently, I can say that I have overcome my biggest fear during this challenging time of Covid -19. The fear I had about going to school and then about doing online and virtual class work has subsided. I have become more confident, stronger mentally and emotionally, and I have faced my biggest fare during this challenging time.",

I made an 180 degree turn in my life, finally facing the truth of what ""life"" was and how it could be. I went from extremely motivated, bubbly, energetic, and having a passion for learning to depressed, unmotivated, having low self-esteem and extremely unhappy. I moved from across the country to a university that I prayed to go to, only to have that accomplishment pummeled in a matter of months. I faced several low points in my life during the pandemic including depression and temporary homelessness.  Around March 13th, 2020, I was required to move off campus due to COVID restrictions. Since Valdosta State University had become my permanent place of residence, I had nowhere to go. Thankfully my grandmother had an extra room at her home in South Carolina and assured me that I was more than welcome to stay there with her. During the moving process, I was forced to sell my car because I knew it wouldn't make the four and half hour drive to South Caroline. This debacle left me car-less and temporarily homeless with my belongings spread out across two states. My world was falling apart and there wasn't anything I could do to repair the damage that had been done.   Several weeks passed following the move-out situation, but I was tempted to give up and withdraw from my courses. I had no motivation to continue. I wasn't eating, sleeping, or going outside. I laid in bed and cried several times a day, thinking that I had hit rock bottom.  BUT, there was light at the end of the tunnel! After three months, I finally realized that my habits and actions weren't healthy and were only hindering me and my growth as an individual. I told myself that I had to get out of this rut or else I would be setting my life up for failure. I knew that God would guide me and help me find the reason and purpose for this endeavor â€“ and he did! I had found a retail job in Augusta, GA which helped me with my isolation issues. I've always been a people-person and had great interpersonal skills, but the pandemic brought that to a screeching halt. I was also able to save for my first apartment, received a car from my grandmother, finally saw the beauty in myself, and was determined to pull myself up from the sunken place I was in.  Come 2022, I have accomplished SO much!  I maintained my Dean's List status, obtained multiple leadership roles at my university, and worked with three Fortune 100 companies including J.P. Morgan, Procter & Gamble and Goldman Sachs. I reminded myself that I had put everything on the line when I moved to Valdosta and couldn't afford to lose all that I had worked for. The pandemic proved to be an extremely motivating factor in my life and showed me that ""Greatness lies ahead, don't give up today"". ",

As a recent graduate and being in the first semester of my graduate degree program, I have faced many challenges that I have had to learn to overcome during this pandemic. I came to college in 2018, so I only had one in-person interaction for an internship out of the 4 that I completed during my undergrad degree program and one year of in-person classes before we went virtual. When I first came to college, I was always the one who sat in the front of the class, participated, and asked many questions. When my university went virtual, that took away the personal and social interaction that I needed in order to thrive within the classroom. It was harder for professors to lecture in a way for students to understand, which made learning more difficult. This transition from in-person to online affected the level of motivation that I had for learning and getting work done but even with these learning barriers I still managed to obtain A's and B's and graduate Summa Cum Laude with my accounting degree.    From a professional perspective, during my internships that were virtual over the summer, the motivation was present, but I always lacked that personal connection that I needed to learn about a company.  I found myself having to go the extra mile to network when that may have come naturally from working in the office. With this challenge, I have always managed to have a successful internship, add value to the organization, and receive a return offer.  The feeling of un-motivation has also taken a toll on my mental health, in ways that cause me to think that I am mediocre or not intelligent enough or experienced enough to obtain jobs and internships at the same pace as my counterparts. I have overcome these challenges, thoughts, and barriers to my success by pushing myself and always keeping my goals in the front of my mind. I am the first one in my family to go to college and take this path to the corporate world, so I am creating a legacy for myself and my family. I am continuing to strive to new heights daily to reach my full potential regardless of the challenges I face. Understanding that there is a purpose behind every challenge we face allows that experience to make us stronger each time that we overcome them. ",Yes
