I was starting my first collegiate softball season in March 2020 when after our first double-header in West Chester, PA, my head coach informed my team and I that our season must come to a halt due to the pandemic. We all had to move off campus immediately. It was disappointing for me just because I had finally got to experience college life and felt confident about it. My first-year class and I were terribly upset about the news because of how tightly knit we were as a class and the amount of fun we were having while being together on the field and off in our free time. We had just accomplished a goal we had all had since we were little together to play collegiate softball, just for it to come to a stop after our first official game. I was heartbroken because I was in a happy space my freshman year. Living on my own in an apartment with five of my teammates and best friends, feeling independent, being just the right number of miles away from home where it was comfortable and appropriate to go home whenever I felt. Another challenge after that was trying to make money to save while being home from college and keep my family safe and free of Covid at the same time. I lived with my elderly grandmother during that time, so it was very difficult to work full-time at a restaurant serving, and not bring the virus home to my grandmother. As a server, we are exposed to multiple different tables and people throughout our entire shift. Touching people used plates, silverware, hovering over them as they ate with their masks down, exchanging cash and credit cards, etc. As a college athlete, we do not have time to work during our time on campus. Most of our time outside of class is devoted to practicing, games, sporting events, studying, meetings, team bonding, etc. So yes, during my time off from softball, I felt the need to work full-time to save and have money put away for when I did go back to campus. I am very independent and do not ask my parents or anyone for money. I am very grateful for the way my parents have raised me and the hustler mindset they have embedded in me over my adolescent years. Luckily, my family and I were Covid free until this past holiday season. I tested positive and was quarantined during New Years of 2021. It was depressing to see all my friends on social media having fun and going out for their New Years, while I stayed at home in a room eating things that I could not taste or smell. Luckily, my grandmother has stayed Covid free and healthy. In conclusion, I have battled through tough times that the Covid pandemic has set upon me.",

Okonjo Iweala, the current Director of World Trade Organization, was the charismatic personality my Economics Teacher in High School said I would be like. She had spoken about women in Nigeria taking over their finances and stance and I found myself wanting to help women on that journey. It was one of the reasons I chose to study Accounting as an undergraduate student. While these comments were seemingly harmless, they internally gave me burdens that I did not know how to empty.  Although it's a beautiful goal I had outlined, it came with a lot of anxiety, sleepless night and pressure to be this ""excellent representation"". I never really sat with my feelings, I just prayed, did my routines and moved to the next class or do whatever I needed to complete. I remember while as an undergrad, all I wanted to do was graduate but after graduation especially during covid, I felt this deep emptiness nothing else could fill. I was doing well in classes but wasn't really learning and assimilating the material. Yes, I oversaw many organizations on campus and did everything to the best of my abilities. I even got an award for excellence, but I was sad, depressed and felt alone. Worse, I had Covid, the deadly-killing virus that left me with a long-lasting brain fog. It was at that moment, I decided to slow down. I began questioning every single decision I have made. It was then I decided to see a therapist.  While reexamining what matters, which is the gift of life, I decided to treat myself with more kindness. I have always been in the mode of ""unto the next"", during my educational growth but now I am learning to live in the moment and focus on my life motto: ""being intentional about loving people and myself"".  My therapist said, ""Mirabel, it is wonderful that you have these goals, but you cannot not lift others as you climb if you have not learned to carry yourself up first"". It was so freeing to deeply understand that. As I healed physically from covid, I healed emotionally and mentally. The importance of mental health could no longer be underestimated. I had to share what I learned in therapy with other women that were also struggling with their mental health. I created a group chat to support young adults fighting the emptiness they feel. We shared multiple podcasts, songs, books like ""Cleaning Your Mental Mess"" by Dr Caroline Leaf, ""Set Boundaries, Find Peace"" by Nedra Tawwab and many more. Taking care of my mental health wasn't easy but has made me feel empowered to overcome our unique challenges and have gained a support system that seeks to keep on lifting as they climb.",

I know in my situation I was constantly worrying about whether the healthcare system in my country would support my parents or my grandparents. I constantly worried about my parents' business, if it would survive the pandemic because Zimbabwe just doesn't have facilities to support small businesses that are in person, what more businesses becoming largely remote? Simple transactions like telegraphic transfer for my tuition couldn't be performed. This burdened me. Being an international student is an emotional rollercoaster. This pandemic highlighted to me that I do not enjoy being so far from home because life is not guaranteed. One thing I struggled with was hearing about the deaths of those close to me. Many lives were lost during the pandemic, and I guess for me the battle I must face is acknowledging that this person who I left at home 6 months ago won't be there when I return. I constantly asked myself if this would be true of my parents or my siblings and if I would be able to process the death of my own blood. Would I be able to grieve alone here and restart this process when I go home, and the actual realities hit me? I had to overcome myself, my old ways of thinking, my feelings, and my biases. I realized that the only thing I could control was my mental health and my grades. Letting go of the ""what ifs"", made me lose a sense of control. I felt like I was in the unknown, I felt so hollow, so lost and so helpless. I mean what could I have done to stop the effects of this pandemic? Daily I took active steps to affirm myself, that one day when the travel ban is lifted, I will go home, and everyone will be alive. I kept saying to myself that ""this too shall pass"", I kept reminding myself that my feelings are not reliable because they change and fluctuate, but good habits will keep my grades high and keep me mentally sane and steady, my discipline held me when I couldn't hold myself together. These past few semesters I have learnt resilience and grit. I have learnt strength in so many ways. I have learnt to accept that my thoughts can be so shallow and can be easily clouded by my feelings. I learnt the importance of goal setting and overcoming. I always wanted to be the successful girl who took ginormous steps and leaps into success.  I have accepted that I am still a girl who wants to be successful, but I need to cultivate good habits. I need to take it one day at a time and always factor in the unknown, it is my duty to overcome.",

My parents lost their jobs, and the family depended on unemployment to survive. This saddened me because neither of my parents had a college education; I was a first-generation college student. This was a hard time for me because I was finishing up at a community college and transferring to a 4-year university. The expenses after financial aid were still more than we could afford. I had to take a full-time job at a local grocery store while doing my 15 credits for the semester. It was very stressful and hard for me because I had no time for myself. I worked at least 40 hours a week and spent my time off doing homework and studying. None of these discouraged me because my grades and relationship with my professors were great. Even with my cup full, I was making the presidential scholar list at my community college. This job taught me to value time and money well. These were my routines until my parents got a new job and I was able to reduce my hours to 15 a week. This pandemic taught me to not give up but work harder to achieve my goal. Some of my friends with whom I started community college dropped out to work full-time. They were not to be blamed because everyone is different and has different aspirations in life. With my aspiration to be a partner or a CFO at a big firm in the future, this pandemic could not overturn my dream.",
